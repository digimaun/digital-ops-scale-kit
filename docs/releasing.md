# Prepare and publish a release

Prepare the release tag, headline, and notes in a pull request. After merge,
review the candidate and approve publication. A candidate is the exact source
commit, release declaration, notes, and asset bytes proposed for that release.

Site Ops and Scale Kit have independent version streams in the same repository.
A content release can reference an existing engine release without rebuilding
it or changing its version.

A detached attestation proof is a separate file containing signed provenance
evidence for an artifact. Each signed artifact has its own proof.

## Choose the right workflow

| Workflow | Use it for | Can it publish a release? |
|---|---|---|
| **CI** | Code and runner checks, attestation diagnostics, installer checks, or a release preview | No |
| **Release (approval required)** | Preparing and publishing a reviewed release | Only after the configured reviewer approves |

These workflows share candidate preparation. A CI preview is not a pending
release and cannot be promoted. A real release prepares its own candidate from
the reviewed files on `main`.

CI run titles identify the selected mode and branch. The **Overview** summary
shows ordinary checks and only the optional path selected for that run.
The graph still contains the workflow's other branches because GitHub controls
its layout. Detailed installation and release reports remain in their jobs.

If **Release (approval required)** is not available in Actions, its workflow
file must first exist on the repository's default branch. Use the already
registered CI workflow to preview changes on a feature branch. Changing the default
branch or pushing the feature directly to `main` is not needed for a preview.

## Configure release artifact runners

In each publishing or rehearsal repository, set the Actions repository variable
`SITEOPS_RELEASE_POOL` to its dedicated 1ES GitHub runner pool name. Register
the pool for that exact repository. A fork has its own configuration and pool,
separate from the upstream repository.

Use `runner-check` to confirm the pool's baseline. A fork can also run the
attestation diagnostic below. Review the repository registration, maintained
image, isolation controls and verification policy, then
set `SITEOPS_RELEASE_PROVENANCE_READY` to `true` to enable artifact execution
in that repository. An absent or different value keeps admission closed
before worker allocation. Configuring the fork does not enable the upstream
repository. Run an approved release preview to qualify the actual artifact
path before publication.

Artifact execution requires `SITEOPS_RELEASE_RUNNER_MODE=scaleset` and an
enrolled Scale Set pool. Each artifact job checks its Linux `self-hosted`
runtime before source or artifact work. Verification separately requires
that exact signing class and the selected repository, source and workflow
identities. A pool label or runner class does not establish 1ES membership.

| Work | Runner |
|---|---|
| Runner configuration admission | Public GitHub runner, without source checkout or write permissions |
| Release preparation, engine and workspace builds, signing, descriptor and payload assembly, publication | Configured 1ES pool |
| Lint, unit tests, template validation, installation and workspace qualification, result summaries | Public GitHub runners |

The admission job requires the expected source commit and a supported calling
workflow before allocating release workers. CI requests release workers only for
explicit `installer-check` or `release-preview` dispatches. The Release workflow
requires `main`. Pull request events cannot enter the reusable release producers.
Missing or malformed pool configuration fails explicitly, with no fallback to
public runners.

The pool comes from repository configuration, not a release declaration or
dispatch override. Artifact jobs request only the admitted pool name.
Keep source builds separate from signing and publishing jobs. Their
permissions and publication approval remain independent
of runner placement.

Use the maintained runner image for baseline tools. Existing workflow steps
select Python, install locked packages through the configured feed and verify
the Bicep compiler before use. A custom image bootstrap is not required.

### Check the runner without producing artifacts

Use **Actions > CI > Run workflow**, select a reviewed branch, choose
`runner-check` for `run-mode`, and enter its full `expected-source-sha`.
The configured pool runs two short jobs without repository checkout, signing
permissions, artifact production or deployment. The first records baseline
Python, Git, GitHub CLI and Azure CLI versions using temporary empty profiles.
The second requires a different boot session. The summary contains tool
versions and the comparison outcome, not machine identities or credentials.
For legacy routing, set the repository Actions variable `SITEOPS_RELEASE_IMAGE`
to the approved image name configured in that pool before using this mode. The diagnostic
requests `self-hosted`, the configured pool label and an explicit
`1ES.ImageOverride` label. Missing or malformed image configuration stops
admission before allocation. The image choice is not a dispatch override.

For a pool explicitly enrolled in the 1ES Scale Set API preview, set the
repository variable `SITEOPS_RELEASE_RUNNER_MODE` to `scaleset`.
An unset variable or `legacy` retains legacy routing for `runner-check`.
Artifact execution requires `scaleset`. Other values stop admission rather
than choosing a fallback.

The Scale Set diagnostic requests only the admitted pool name. It uses the
pool's configured image, rather than `SITEOPS_RELEASE_IMAGE`, and sends no
`self-hosted`, `1ES.Pool`, `ImageOverride` or `JobId` demand labels.
Configure a single image on that pool before using this preview.
The variable must agree with the pool's integration mode. It does not
reconfigure the pool. Other repositories retain their own routing settings.

Scale Set routing supports the diagnostics and explicitly enabled artifact
jobs. Preview support limitations apply.

This mode does not change release admission. Different boot sessions
do not establish complete machine isolation, Trusted Launch or provenance.
Ordinary CI still runs on public runners, and `release-file` is ignored.

### Inspect an attestation from the fork runner

After `runner-check` succeeds on a fork's Scale Set pool, choose
`attestation-check` for `run-mode` and enter the reviewed branch's full
`expected-source-sha`. This mode requires a fork, a manual branch dispatch,
and `SITEOPS_RELEASE_RUNNER_MODE=scaleset`. It waits for ordinary CI to pass.
The `release-file` input is ignored.

This is real signing. It creates a public attestation and permanent
transparency record identifying the fork, workflow and commit, even if later
verification fails. Deleting the run or its temporary artifacts does not remove
that record. Approve those consequences before dispatching.

The 1ES job creates only `runner-check.txt` with fixed diagnostic text and
attests it without checking out repository source. A public runner downloads
the exact evidence artifact, uses stock GitHub CLI verification, and compares
the observed certificate with the expected repository, branch, source commit,
reusable signer, caller workflow and `self-hosted` class. This diagnostic uses
the CLI's online trust roots. Release consumers retain their separate policy
and trusted root requirements.

The subject and detached proof are retained as a workflow artifact for seven
days. If signature verification succeeds, its bounded JSON result is also
retained, including when the later certificate comparison fails. A failed
comparison requires investigation rather than wider identity matching.

This mode creates no tag or release and leaves the production verification
policy and release gate unchanged. A `self-hosted` certificate does not identify
a particular pool or establish Trusted Launch, complete worker isolation or
release authority. The upstream pool and installed engine compatibility require
their own qualification.

## Preview a release without publishing

In **Actions > CI > Run workflow**, select the feature branch and choose:

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| `run-mode` | `release-preview` |
| `expected-source-sha` | The selected branch's full commit SHA |
| `release-file` | Keep the supplied example, or select a committed `releases/<name>/release.json` |

To obtain the SHA, open the selected branch's latest commit and copy its full
commit identifier. This field confirms which commit will run. It does not
select an older commit from the branch.

The default example is
`.github/release-examples/workspace-preview/release.json`. It builds one
complete IoT Operations workspace and the selected engine from the chosen
source commit. Choose
`.github/release-examples/combined-preview/release.json` to preview engine
artifacts under a content tag. Examples are accepted only by a release preview
and never trigger publication when merged.

For the default example, the CI preview performs real builds and signing, but
it cannot publish and cannot be promoted into a release. Once the repository
opts in to artifact execution as described above, it follows ordinary CI with
these steps:

1. Prepares the exact release plan and requested engine assets.
2. Builds each declared workspace with read permissions, using that release
   plan and checking any committed indexes for freshness.
3. Creates a proof for each workspace package and build record. A collector
   with read permissions verifies those subjects before creating the public
   workspace routing descriptor.
4. Installs the selected engine from its authenticated lock and checks package
   compatibility, protected cache use, and guarded catalog loading on every
   declared Windows or Linux Python platform. Each platform also creates an
   operator project for the first declared workspace through the installed engine.
5. Requires all qualification results to identify the same engine, workspace
   inventory, release plan and project pin. It signs the generated engine
   reference and freezes the complete publication inventory.
6. Admits that frozen payload from the selected producer run and attempt.
   A separate job checks the artifact IDs, complete inventory, exact bytes
   and subject provenance before retaining an admission receipt.

Workspace qualification does not compare executable deployment plans,
authorize deployment, deploy resources, or evaluate workload health. Publication
remains a separate approval step.

Candidate admission accepts a completed producer even while the surrounding
release workflow is still running or awaiting approval. Its receipt records
the source, caller, run, attempt and selected digests, and explicitly marks
installation and deployment as not run. It is an input gate for subsequent
acceptance, not evidence of a fleet deployment or workload readiness.
Preview admission retains its preview identity and cannot authorize publication.

Content releases that declare workspaces also publish `siteops-engine.json`
and its detached proof. The signed reference identifies the exact engine
release, source revision, version, installation bundle and proof selected
for that content release. Combined prereleases identify their colocated
engine. Releases with only content identify the existing engine without copying
or rebuilding its assets.

The reference contains identities, not download URLs, credentials or
publisher policy. Its signature and the engine bundle's own provenance must
both satisfy independent consumer policy. It does not replace the unsigned
`siteops-workspaces.json` routing descriptor, enroll a source or choose
the newest engine satisfying a compatibility range. A compatible bootstrap
can consume it through [content release selection](install-siteops.md#install-the-engine-selected-by-a-content-release).
Direct engine installation commands remain supported.

The default preview's final summary shows one matrix of Python versions and
platforms, plus a link to the attested release assets. Ubuntu 26.04 and the
Windows standard user run only with Python 3.11, so other rows show `n/a` in
those columns. The installer check fails unless every declared cell passes
exactly once. Individual job logs remain available for diagnosis.

This path needs no `siteops-release` environment. Its jobs have no permission
to write repository contents, request no publishing approval, and
create no tag or GitHub Release. A release plan from a preview cannot be used
by the publisher.

The other `run-mode` choices are `installer-check` for CI plus bundle and
installation checks, and `ci-only` for ordinary CI. `ci-only` uses neither
additional input. `installer-check` uses the SHA but ignores `release-file`.
None of these modes publishes a release.

A successful CI release preview exercises preparation and the builds, signing,
and qualification required by its declaration. Script commands that accept
`--dry-run` can instead perform unsigned local preparation. The flag alone
does not imply signing. The approval UI and release upload still require a
configured environment and explicit approval.

### Read the Windows standard user check

The **Qualify bundle (windows-2025, Python 3.11, standard user)** job creates
a temporary local account in the Users group. It stages the verified bootstrap
and bundle in a folder that account can only read and execute, then runs the
signed bootstrap unchanged as that account. The account acquires its own uv
and Python, consumes the staged bundle without a download, and installs Site
Ops in its own profile. The job then removes the account, its profile and the
staging folder.

The job log starts with `GitHub CLI preflight` lines that report the owner and
writer classes of `gh.exe` and each parent folder. The bootstrap admits GitHub
CLI only when Administrators, SYSTEM, TrustedInstaller or the current user own
and control it, so a `job-account` or `other` class explains a `GH_ADMISSION`
failure. A failure names one fixed category, such as `ROOT_DATA_ACL`,
`TOOL_OWNER`, `GH_ADMISSION`, `GH_VERSION`, `STAGING_ACCESS`,
`CACHE_NOT_USED` or `TIMEOUT`. Before `STAGING_ACCESS`, `Staging access` lines
report the owner and access rules of each staged item by class, such as
`job-account` or `standard-user`. The
bootstrap log stays in the temporary profile and is never published.

## Fleet resource ownership

The qualification helpers in `scripts/manage-release-fleet.py` operate on
two fixed slots rather than accepting arbitrary resource group names.
Each operation binds the selected admission receipt, acceptance run/attempt
and explicit Azure subscription. The public scope binding and Azure resource
names are derived separately, so the receipt does not disclose resource group names.

Preflight requires both groups to be absent and records hashes of distinct
private ownership markers. Retain its ownership receipt durably before
allowing creation, including when later provisioning might fail. Preflight
and creation also require `--allocation-state PATH`: preflight writes the
private markers there, and creation reads that same file. Never upload it.
Creation and cleanup require `--execute`, the ownership receipt and its
selected digest. These tools use the caller's approved Azure identity and
do not sign in or grant permissions.
Take the receipt and expected digest from the trusted qualification run,
not workspace content. A digest check establishes identity, not authority.

Creation binds each group through Azure's immutable `managedBy` property.
An existing group with another value cannot acquire this run's marker
through an update. Cleanup requires that property's hash to match the
original receipt, together with the expected resource identity and tags.
Receipts without marker commitments are not sufficient for automatic cleanup.
Cleanup observes both groups until absence is confirmed or a bounded deadline
expires. Missing ownership, residual resources and unknown observations
remain explicit failing outcomes. An accepted deletion request is not
confirmation that deletion finished. Cleanup preserves an earlier operation
failure or interruption code even when resource removal succeeds.

The ownership receipt supports a separately authorized reconciliation after
cancellation. Reuse the original candidate, run/attempt and subscription.
Reconciliation downloads the original receipt by its bound artifact ID with
digest checking, rather than regenerating its commitments. Then repeat the
ownership checks. Never substitute a search across the subscription or general
resource janitor. Keep provider diagnostics and allocation state private.
These helpers do not install Site Ops, deploy AIO or establish workload health.

The producer's **Exact candidate selection** summary identifies the
exact admitted plan, engine, workspaces and inventory for Site and fleet acceptance.
The manual `scenario=fleet` E2E path uses the same selection.
See [fleet acceptance and its runtime budget](e2e-testing.md#qualify-one-exact-candidate-across-two-sites).
That path installs the selected engine outside checkout, seeds the normal
operator project, coordinates two live hosts, and requires bound deployment,
readiness and cleanup receipts. It does not rebuild candidate assets.
The Release workflow runs the fleet as part of
[candidate acceptance](#accept-the-candidate). A manual `scenario=fleet` run
remains available for diagnosis but does not satisfy publication.

## Qualify the Azure Pipelines templates

This harness qualifies the Azure Pipelines templates that customers use.
Customers use the consumer pipelines and reusable templates in
[CI/CD setup](ci-cd-setup.md#azure-devops), with their own content and
deployment identity.

1. Register `.pipelines/validate-pipelines.yaml` once using **Existing Azure
   Pipelines YAML file** and the reviewed source branch. Save the definition
   before running it. An existing definition pointing at this path can be
   reused.
2. Configure the agent's approved Python package feed. Template expansion
   uses the service connection and variable group names in the Environment
   settings blocks of `.pipelines/deploy.yaml` and
   `.pipelines/integration-test.yaml`. The preview checks that each
   environment selects its own pair.
   A `PIP_INDEX_URL` pipeline variable can select the approved feed when
   required by your organization. On this qualification pipeline only,
   allow **Edit build pipeline** for the project build service identity,
   `<project> Build Service (<organization>)`. Template previews submit
   pipeline YAML through `yamlOverride`, which requires that permission.
   Keep the identity's other permissions inherited. The build identity also
   needs read access to its definition and source repository, plus the
   resource authorization required for template expansion. This
   qualification does not need Azure resource roles.
3. Queue one approved run bound to the selected branch and full commit,
   then inspect its qualification summary and `ado-qualification` artifact.

The preview stage discovers its own definition through `System.DefinitionId`
and verifies the repository and qualification pipeline path. CI, deployment
and integration definitions do not need to be registered separately.
The controller requires a clean checkout at the selected commit and reads
the pipeline YAML from committed Git blobs. It submits those documents through
`yamlOverride`, with that same branch and commit bound to every template
expansion. All pipeline documents share the qualification pipeline's
`.pipelines` directory, preserving relative template resolution.

The full preview matrix covers setup options, environment mappings,
planning versus deployment, selectors, Site files, resource set samples
and every integration phase. Both default and enabled WIF session refresh
are expanded. These requests use only the dedicated `/preview` endpoint
and never execute the deployment or integration jobs.

The consumer stages run independently of the preview stage, so a preview
failure does not suppress runtime evidence. Available agent capacity
determines whether the lanes execute concurrently. The Site file case still
follows a successful selector case.

Both consumer stages use the ordinary setup and validation templates.
Each installs the selected checkout with a noneditable pip installation
and runs `validate`, which does not compile, against real fixtures under
`tests/fixtures/ado-consumer`. One case selects a workspace Site by label.
The other uses a standalone Site file outside the workspace inventory.
The fixture includes its referenced ARM JSON and synthetic Site values.
These stages have no Azure task, variable group or mapped preview token.

The final stage waits for both lanes and reads native job outcomes without
polling or queueing other pipelines. All required jobs must return
`Succeeded`, and the complete preview receipt must match the selected
source. Failed, canceled, skipped,
missing or partially successful jobs cannot produce a passing report.
The report includes the identity of the selected source installation and the preview
case inventory with input and expansion digests. Reports are published
only after the reporter creates its own safe output, including failed
qualification results. A canceled run can prevent the reporting stage from
starting, so a missing report is not qualification evidence.

The recorded source commit identifies this pipeline's checkout. Retain a
reviewed mapping that shows source equivalence for a mirror or snapshot, and
keep the original publisher identity for verifying signed releases.

Run only reviewed pipeline source with the explicitly mapped
`System.AccessToken`. The harness has no automatic PR trigger, interactive
login or pipeline creation. Expanded YAML, resource names and raw
service diagnostics are not published. HTTP failures retain the status code
and an allowlisted service exception category. When the service reports an
unlisted exception type whose key has the form of a .NET class name, the
diagnostic also names that type. Messages and other unknown or unreadable
details remain undisclosed. These categories describe the server response, not a
proven cause, and do not trigger retries or a fallback to the execution endpoint.

The preview step is the only step that receives `System.AccessToken`.
Its job installs just the runtime requirements locked by hash as binary
wheels, without a cache, into a private virtual environment. It runs the
controller with `-E -s -B` so Python environment variables, user packages
and bytecode writes stay out of the process that holds the token. Keep **Limit job
authorization scope to current project** enabled and restrict who can edit
or queue this pipeline to maintainers.

A complete passing run qualifies template expansion and the explicit
consumer checks that install from source for that candidate. Qualify verified
release installation, separate caller and automation checkouts, executable
planning, deployment and WIF renewal in separately approved hosted runs.
Release production remains in GitHub Actions.

A separate rehearsal in a customer repository should use the
[reusable template example](ci-cd-setup.md#reference-the-deployment-template-from-another-repository)
and confirm both checkouts, engine origin, workspace selection
and configured overrides. Local tests exercise those script/path boundaries.
Only a separately approved hosted run qualifies repository service
connections, agent tasks and Azure authentication. A preview success does
not establish those outcomes. For WIF refresh, retain the actual task version
and run long enough to exercise token renewal and a subsequent authorized
Azure operation. Confirm refresh failure is visible and the final task result
preserves any deployment failure. Local controls and template previews do
not establish that live token lifecycle.

## Prepare the real release files

Create a new directory for each release:

```text
releases/<name>/release.json
releases/<name>/notes.md
```

`release.json` specifies the tag, headline, and engine selection. `notes.md`
contains the Markdown release notes. The tag defines the release version.
The folder name identifies the record, rather than providing another version
setting.

The release title is `<tag>: <headline>`. For example, a declaration with
`"tag": "v1.0.0b8"` and `"headline": "Native Site Ops installation"` produces
`v1.0.0b8: Native Site Ops installation`. Use 1-120 printable characters for
the headline, with no line breaks or surrounding whitespace. Describe the main
operator benefit rather than repeating the product name or version.

Start the notes with `## Highlights` and explain what operators can do with
this release. Include `## Upgrading` when existing users must take action,
linking to the applicable migration instructions. The GitHub release title
already identifies the release, so the notes do not need another title.

Write the changes and guidance specific to the release in `notes.md`. The workflow
adds **Install Site Ops** automatically. It includes the exact versioned wheel
URL for native uv, the configured package index policy, and complete Bash
and PowerShell bootstrap commands bound to the frozen script bytes and
source identities. It includes the release asset links and verified
installation guide pinned to the source commit. The HTTPS route checks
the script against the reviewed instructions. Independent script provenance
verification remains a separate route with its own tooling prerequisite.
A content release that references an existing engine links to
that independently published release. There is no need to copy installation
commands, source hashes, or download URLs into the authored notes.

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/release-examples/<name>/` | Safe examples accepted only by previews |
| `releases/<name>/` | Reviewed files that can start a real release |

Merging examples does not start the publishing workflow. Create a new folder
under `releases/` for a real release, with its intended tag and notes.
CI validates changed release declarations on pull requests.
Invalid fields, version choices, headlines, or record paths fail before the
publication workflow needs to build installation assets.

Choose the components through the release tag and engine selection:

| Components | Reviewed declaration |
|---|---|
| Site Ops only | A `siteops/v...` tag that matches the source engine version |
| Content only | A `v...` tag and `siteops.release` naming an existing engine release |
| Both | A prerelease `v...` tag and `siteops.build: true` |

The generated release plan and approval summary show that resolved choice, the
content version, and whether the engine is built or referenced. The workflow
uses that reviewed choice directly. The examples below illustrate formats, not
scheduled releases.

### Release Site Ops independently

```json
{
  "tag": "siteops/v1.1.0",
  "headline": "Native installation and deployment outcomes"
}
```

The version must exactly match `siteops.__version__` in the selected source
commit. The workflow builds the engine wheel once with that source version. It
publishes the identical standalone wheel and includes those same bytes in a ZIP
with the pinned runtime wheels, `pylock.toml`, the frozen source's
`siteops-install.py` helper, metadata, and notices. Scale Kit
content does not need a version change.

The current beta policy still keeps the source package at `1.0.0b1`.
Do not create another Site Ops beta tag without an approved change to the
version policy.

Publication now requires [candidate acceptance](#accept-the-candidate), which
deploys the release's `workspaces/iot-operations` workspace. A release that
contains only the engine has no workspace to accept, so it cannot be published
until engine only acceptance is defined. Release the engine together with
content instead.

### Release content against an existing engine

```json
{
  "tag": "v1.2.0",
  "headline": "Fleet workload configuration",
  "siteops": {
    "release": "siteops/v1.1.0"
  }
}
```

This references a published Site Ops release in the same repository. It does
not build an engine bundle or depend on the current engine development version
on `main`. Confirm content compatibility with the referenced engine as part of
the release evidence.

The reference is an exact engine release, not a range with a minimum version.
Stable content requires a stable referenced engine release. Candidate
preparation requires its complete native asset set and freezes the GitHub
digests. Earlier engine releases with four assets (ZIP, standalone
wheel and a proof for each) remain valid references. Newer releases also
carry both bootstrap scripts and their separate proofs. Referencing an
older release with four assets does not make the bootstrap routes available.
A release that contains only a ZIP is rejected.

Add reviewed `workspaces` records to publish complete workspace packages
and their proofs with the content release. Their package version comes
from the content tag, while the referenced engine retains its own version
and assets. See [workspace production](workspace-packages.md#build-workspaces-declared-by-a-release).

### Include an engine build in a content prerelease

```json
{
  "tag": "v1.0.0b8",
  "headline": "Native Site Ops installation",
  "siteops": {
    "build": true
  }
}
```

This is the combined prerelease path. The content tag advances independently,
while the source engine version follows its existing policy. The included
engine receives a distinguishable build version such as
`1.0.0b1+build.12345.1.gabcdef123456`.

It creates one content release with the Site Ops ZIP, standalone wheel,
`siteops-bootstrap.sh`, `siteops-bootstrap.ps1`, and a separate detached
proof for each. Any declared workspace packages have their own proofs.
It does not create another Site Ops tag.
This option requires a prerelease content version. Stable content references
a separately released engine instead.

## Release fields and defaults

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tag` | Required version identity. `v...` releases Scale Kit content, while `siteops/v...` releases the engine independently. |
| `headline` | Required short description used with the tag to form the release title. |
| `siteops` | Required for a content release. Choose `{"build": true}` or `{"release": "siteops/v<version>"}`. Omit it for an independent engine release. |
| `workspaces` | Optional reviewed workspace build inputs for a content release. See [workspace production](workspace-packages.md#build-workspaces-declared-by-a-release). Publication requires every declared package, its proof, the routing descriptor and the signed engine reference. |
| `latest` | Optional, defaults to `false`. Set `true` only to designate a stable Scale Kit release as GitHub's Latest release. |

`siteops.build` is a selection, not an on/off switch. `true` includes a fresh
engine build in a content prerelease. `false` is not supported: name an existing
engine release instead. Independent engine releases always build their own
assets from the matching source package version.

Prerelease status comes from the tag, with no separate `prerelease` field.
Versions containing a development, alpha, beta, or release candidate suffix,
such as `v0.0.2.dev20260912`, `v1.0.0b8`, or `v1.0.0rc1`, are prereleases.
`v1.0.0` is stable. Stable content must reference a stable engine release.

`latest` controls GitHub's Latest badge for the repository and
`releases/latest` destination. It does not update installed applications.
Use `true` when publishing the stable content release you want that destination
to recommend. Prereleases and independent Site Ops releases cannot take over
that designation. A stable release may still use `latest: false`.

Do not commit source hashes, run IDs, artifact IDs, artifact digests, or a
`published` flag into the release file. These are generated evidence or GitHub
state, not authoring inputs. Keep published release files as historical records
rather than maintaining a mutable `next release` file.

Notes are plain Markdown. Release files cannot supply local hooks, commands,
arbitrary repository URLs, or custom paths for note files.

## Prepare and review the candidate

```text
Release files PR
          |
          v
Merge to main at commit A
          |
          v
Read release files from A
Run CI for A
Build and attest the requested engine and workspace assets
Qualify native installation and workspace consumption as applicable
Admit the frozen candidate
          |
          v
Start one Release acceptance run for that exact candidate
          |
          v
Review the candidate summary and the passed acceptance run
          |
          v
Approve tag creation and publication
          |
          v
Verify the bound acceptance, then tag A and publish the same qualified bytes
```

Use one release folder for each PR that prepares a release. A push to `main` that
changes `releases/<name>/release.json` or `notes.md` starts preparation,
normally as the result of merging that PR. Protect `main` with required pull
requests to enforce the review step. The workflow itself listens for the
matching push, not a PR event. If several release folders change together,
automatic selection stops instead of choosing one silently.

Normally, no manual dispatch or SHA input is needed after merging the release
files. Open the automatically started **Release (approval required)** run to
review its candidate. Automatic preparation still waits for human approval
before publication.

The workflow reads metadata and notes from the selected Git commit. It does
not depend on a mutable checkout or select the newest successful build later.
Source and artifact identities remain fixed while approval is pending.
An unrelated advance of `main` does not change the candidate. Changing its
release file or notes requires a fresh candidate and approval.

The approval summary shows the components, tag, source commit, independent
content and engine versions, engine selection, title, ZIP and wheel digests
when applicable, tag action, and final release notes.
The summary nests the note headings beneath **Release notes**. Published notes
retain their authored Markdown heading levels. Installation commands are
included in the final notes before approval and remain bound to that approval.
Download the complete candidate payload from the summary for a local trial.
It includes the declared workspace assets and, when an engine is built, its
installation ZIP, standalone wheel, both bootstrap scripts, and a separate
proof for each. The pipeline authenticates all four engine subjects and
confirms the application wheel bytes in the ZIP and standalone wheel match.
For a verified installation, consume only the ZIP and its proof by following
[the installation guide](install-siteops.md).
The generated online command is for the published release.
For a candidate preview, use the Actions artifact above the notes and the
installation guide's steps for manually downloaded files.

The frozen asset inventory separates files to publish from assets that remain
in an existing engine release. Every asset records its filename, byte size, and
SHA-256 digest.
Referenced engine assets retain their own release identity and tag target.
They are not uploaded to the content release again. The publisher consumes
the approved publication list and compares the uploaded identities with that
list.

When workspaces are declared, the final payload combines their qualified ZIPs,
proofs, `siteops-workspaces.json` and the signed `siteops-engine.json` reference
with any engine assets built for this
release. The referenced engine's files remain in its own release. Candidate
preparation compares its frozen engine selection with the current native
inventory, preserving the exact engine that qualified the workspaces.

This approval inventory is distinct from the public `siteops-workspaces.json`
routing descriptor. Workspace package delivery is described in
[workspace release sources](workspace-sources.md).

The workflow runs CI and applicable engine and workspace qualification. For
content releases, the reviewer must also confirm the applicable content/AIO
evidence and any valid evidence carried forward from earlier qualification.
The release run itself deploys no Azure resources. It starts a separate
acceptance run that deploys and removes test resources in the `dev`
environment. Neither run infers workload health from installation success.

## Accept the candidate

After candidate admission, the **Start candidate acceptance** job starts one
**E2E Tests** run titled **Release acceptance** on `main` for the exact
candidate. Its job summary links that run. The acceptance run uses the `dev`
environment in `eastus2`, runs the single Site cases and the fleet in parallel
and aggregates one receipt for the candidate:

| Scenario | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `installer` | Every declared installer cell passed for the frozen bundle, including Ubuntu 26.04 and the Windows standard user |
| `site-aio` | Guided AIO installation on one Site with Secret Sync absent |
| `site-existing-secretsync` | Secret Sync enabled on an existing instance with a precreated vault |
| `site-combined` | AIO and Secret Sync deployed together |
| `fleet` | Two Sites deployed by one installed invocation with `--parallel 2` |

Each Site and fleet scenario removes its resources and must confirm their
absence. Acceptance does not check workload data flow or secret
materialization. A candidate without the `workspaces/iot-operations` workspace
has no acceptance selection, so it cannot be published.

### Configure the acceptance environment

Acceptance reuses the `dev` environment and its `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`,
`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID` secrets.
By default, each attempt creates new resource groups and deletes them, which
needs Owner on the subscription. To use existing groups instead, add these
`dev` environment secrets:

| Secret | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `E2E_SITE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | One existing group name | The single Site cases run one after another in that group |
| `E2E_FLEET_RESOURCE_GROUPS` | Two group names separated by a comma, without spaces | Each fleet slot uses one of them |

Each name uses only letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `(`, `)` and `-`, has at most
90 characters and does not end with `.`. All names must differ, including the
Site group and both fleet groups. Each receipt row records whether its
scenario used `ephemeral` or `persistent` groups. Publication accepts either
mode.

### Hold merges until acceptance starts

Dispatch selects a branch, not a commit, so **Start candidate acceptance**
first confirms that `main` still points at the candidate commit. Hold merges
to `main` from the release merge until that job succeeds. If `main` moved
first, the job fails, and rerunning it fails again. Start a new Release run
from the current `main`, as described in
[Retry or prepare a new candidate](#retry-or-prepare-a-new-candidate).

### Find and rerun the acceptance run

Open the link in the **Start candidate acceptance** summary, or open
**Actions > E2E Tests** and select the newest run titled
**Release acceptance** at the candidate commit.

- A single Site case failed: use **Re-run failed jobs** in that run.
- The fleet failed: use **Re-run all jobs**. A partial fleet rerun stops in
  its first step.

Reruns keep the candidate and write a new receipt for each attempt. The
latest attempt decides. Resources left by an earlier attempt are removed by
its own cleanup, or by a separately approved `scenario=site-cleanup` or
`scenario=fleet-cleanup` run with the same `candidate`.
Set `original-run` and `original-attempt` to the run and attempt that need reconciliation.
In persistent groups, that run removes only what the original attempt
created, as described in [Read the result and retry](e2e-testing.md#read-the-result-and-retry).

### How publication binds acceptance

After approval, the publish job finds the newest **Release acceptance** run of
`.github/workflows/e2e-test.yaml` on `main` at the candidate commit that
carries a receipt for this candidate. A newer run that is still in progress
stops publication. The governing run must have completed successfully, and
its latest attempt must have exactly one unexpired receipt. That receipt must
name this candidate's source, release run and attempt, admission, plan and
inventory digests, the `dev` environment, and every required scenario as
passed with resources confirmed absent. Previews, other branches, other
workflow files and other candidates never satisfy it. All of these checks
run before any tag or release write.

Approve only after the acceptance run succeeds. An earlier approval does not
wait for it. Publication then fails before any write, and you rerun the failed
publish job after acceptance completes, which requests approval again. A
publish rerun keeps the candidate from the original attempt.

### Approver checklist

1. The candidate summary shows the expected release, tag action, source
   commit, notes, digests and installer matrix.
2. The **Release acceptance** run for this candidate succeeded, and its result
   lists every scenario as `passed` with cleanup `confirmed-absent`.
3. Azure Cloud Shell and a Codespace for `Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations`
   each installed the candidate from its Actions download and proof, following
   [the installation guide](install-siteops.md). Record OS and tool versions,
   the candidate identity, the installed command origin, selected inputs, plan,
   deployment, readiness and cleanup in private notes. These runs use staged
   candidate assets, not a public download.
4. For content releases, the applicable content and AIO evidence is confirmed.

## Approve publication

Before preparing a real release, create `siteops-release` in **Settings >
Environments**, add required reviewers, and restrict it to `main`.
This is a GitHub approval gate, not an Azure environment. It needs no
environment secrets for the current workflow.

The workflow checks this after reading an active release file and before
building its native release assets. It also checks for an existing release or
conflicting tag before building. The publisher independently rechecks the
destination after approval. Choose whether reviewers can approve their own
runs and whether administrators can bypass protection, according to
repository policy. Previews do not
need this environment.

`siteops-release` is the shared publication gate for both version streams,
including Scale Kit content releases that reference an existing engine.

After reviewing the generated summary, an authorized reviewer uses **Review
deployments**, selects `siteops-release`, then selects **Approve and deploy**.
This is GitHub's label for allowing the publishing job. It does not deploy
Azure infrastructure. If reviewers cannot approve their own runs, another
reviewer must approve the run.

After approval, the workflow:

1. Locates the governing acceptance run and verifies its receipt for this
   exact candidate, as described in
   [How publication binds acceptance](#how-publication-binds-acceptance).
2. Downloads and verifies the same release file, notes, frozen asset list, and
   qualified release assets.
3. Confirms the release file has not changed and the referenced engine, if any,
   still has the same release identity and tag target.
4. Creates a missing tag at the approved commit, or reuses a tag already
   pointing there. It never moves a conflicting tag.
5. Reauthenticates the ZIP and standalone wheel, confirms their byte identity,
   and reauthenticates each declared workspace package. It compares workspace
   routing, source, package identity and compatibility metadata with the approved
   declaration before creating the release with its unchanged payload.
6. Confirms every uploaded asset digest and verifies GitHub's release
   attestation when immutable releases are enabled.

The destination is the repository running the workflow. Official publication
occurs in `Azure/digital-ops-scale-kit`. A fork's workflow writes only to that
fork. Existing releases are never overwritten.

With native installation assets, GitHub CLI creates a draft, uploads the files,
and then publishes. This temporary draft is not a separate stage for human review.
If immutability is enabled, GitHub locks the uploaded assets and tag when
publication completes. Titles and release notes remain editable through
GitHub's normal controls. The workflow does not enable immutability itself.

## Retry or prepare a new candidate

A failed check stops publication. Missing artifacts, changed release files,
conflicting tags, or an existing release require an explicit resolution rather
than a fallback to different source or replacement assets.

Tag creation and publication are separate GitHub operations. A failure can leave
the correct tag without a completed release. Inspect the result before retrying.
Rebuilding creates a new candidate with its own evidence and approval.

For a transient preparation failure, rerun all jobs in the original workflow
run. After changing source or notes, prepare a new candidate instead.
If an older candidate is still waiting for approval, cancel that superseded
run rather than approving it.
Publication consumes the exact reviewed artifact IDs and hashes, rather than
choosing a different successful build later. A failed publishing operation can
have partial effects, so inspect its result before retrying.

Rerunning all jobs rebuilds the candidate with a new admission, so earlier
acceptance no longer applies and a new acceptance run starts. To retry only
acceptance, rerun the acceptance run as described in
[Find and rerun the acceptance run](#find-and-rerun-the-acceptance-run), then
rerun the failed publish job. Candidate artifacts, reruns and pending
approvals expire after 30 days.

To prepare a new candidate manually, open **Actions > Release (approval
required) > Run workflow** and enter:

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `main` |
| `release-file` | A path relative to the repository, such as `releases/my-release/release.json`, already committed on `main` |
| `expected-source-sha` | The full current commit SHA of `main` |

`release-file` is a path, not an upload or branch selector. This starts the same
real release workflow as the automatic trigger and requests the same approval.
Use it to prepare a new candidate from an existing declaration, for example
after correcting a workflow problem. There is no need to start it manually
when the merge already triggered preparation. If `main` no longer matches the
supplied SHA, preparation stops rather than selecting an older commit.
