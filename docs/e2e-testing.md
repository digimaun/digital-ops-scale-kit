# E2E Testing

The default E2E (end to end) scenario exercises selected Scale Kit deployments
in a live Azure subscription. A workflow matrix cell creates a fresh k3s
cluster, registers it with Azure Arc, deploys Azure IoT Operations through
Site Ops, and runs the selected integration tests. Ephemeral mode normally
deletes its resource group. Persistent mode removes resources in the run's
snapshot delta, and `skip-teardown` preserves them for inspection.

A passing cell establishes only the assertions selected for that AIO release,
mode, and test allowlist. It does not certify an arbitrary cluster, AIO
installation, or workload as ready for production. The AIO runs create Azure
resources and can incur charges until teardown completes.

Use E2E tests when:

- Validating a PR that changes orchestration, merge, or deployment logic.
- Qualifying a new AIO release before updating workspace defaults.
- Reproducing a field issue from start to finish against a real subscription.

Unit tests (`pytest tests/ -m "not integration"`) cover local engine,
workspace, and workflow behavior and should remain the default gate before
each commit. E2E runs only when you dispatch it (`workflow_dispatch`).

### Accept one release candidate

Choose `scenario=release-acceptance` with the JSON from the producer's
**Exact candidate selection** summary as `candidate`. The log of the step
that renders that summary repeats the same JSON on one line that starts with
`Exact candidate selection:`. The release workflow starts this run on
`main` after it admits a candidate, with `environment=dev` and
`location=eastus2`. The run is named **Release acceptance** and runs at the
candidate's source commit. Leave the options for one Site at their defaults,
because the run selects its own cases.

The run starts these scenarios together:

- Three single Site cases through the installed candidate engine and package.
  `disabled` installs AIO only. `enabled` installs AIO with Secret Sync.
  `existing` installs AIO, then enables Secret Sync on that instance with a
  Key Vault created beforehand and passed as `existingVault`.
- The [two Site fleet](#qualify-one-exact-candidate-across-two-sites).

The candidate is labeled prepublication. Each case installs the exact engine
outside the checkout, checks its module origin and seeds its project from the
admitted workspace package. It never reads, enrolls or pins a public release.

#### Choose ephemeral or persistent resource groups

Each scenario selects its groups from its own secret in the selected environment:

| Secret | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `E2E_SITE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | One resource group name | The single Site cases run one after another in this persistent group. |
| `E2E_FLEET_RESOURCE_GROUPS` | Two names separated by one comma, without spaces | Fleet slots `one` and `two` use these persistent groups. |

Without its secret, a scenario uses ephemeral groups. Each Site case or fleet
slot creates a new group named for its run attempt and deletes it afterward,
which needs Owner on the subscription. Persistent groups need Owner on each
group. The run never creates or deletes a persistent group. Before any write
it commits a private snapshot of the group and refuses a group that already
hosts an AIO instance. Cleanup deletes only resources missing from that
snapshot. Use groups dedicated to acceptance and distinct from each other,
and do not deploy into them while a run is active. Group names stay in the
secrets and never appear in logs, outputs or receipts.

Cleanup runs after a failed step and must confirm that everything the attempt
created is gone. Residual or unknown state fails the case. A cancelled run or
a job timeout can stop cleanup, so reconcile that attempt as described below.
Only after confirmed cleanup does the
case purge the soft deleted Key Vaults it created: the vault named for the
attempt, or one found among its own created resources, and only when the
deleted record names that case's group. A purge failure is recorded in the
result without failing acceptance.

#### Read the result and retry

The final job uploads `release-acceptance-<run>-<attempt>-<admission digest>`
with one row each for the installer, the three Site cases and the fleet. A row
records its status, group mode, cleanup and vault purge. Missing, skipped,
duplicated, ambiguous or failed evidence fails the run, and the result is
uploaded either way. When aggregation cannot run, the run uploads a failing
placeholder result for the candidate instead. Publication requires the newest acceptance run for the
candidate to pass.

Site job names match the receipt scenarios: `Site case (site-aio)`,
`Site case (site-combined)` and `Site case (site-existing-secretsync)`.
Reconciliation jobs use `Reconcile original Site case (<scenario>)`.

- Retry a failed Site case with **Re-run failed jobs**. Each attempt uses new
  names and its own snapshot, and the newest attempt of each case governs.
- The fleet must pass within one attempt. Rerunning only its failed jobs stops
  before any Azure work and asks for **Re-run all jobs**.
- Reconcile an attempt whose cleanup did not complete with
  `scenario=site-cleanup` or `scenario=fleet-cleanup`,
  `original-run` and `original-attempt` from that run, the same `candidate`
  and the same environment secrets.
  Reconciliation starts only after every attempt of the original run has
  completed. In a persistent group it removes only resources outside the
  original snapshot, bounded by the completion of the original Site case or
  latest fleet job. Deployments that started before that bound extend it to
  their end, allowing two minutes of clock difference. Later resources stay.
  A deployment still running leaves the case incomplete. Rerun reconciliation
  after it finishes. Resources without a creation time stay and leave the case
  incomplete, so remove them yourself after checking them.

With ephemeral groups the Site cases run in parallel, the fleet is usually the
longest path, and a run takes about 1 to 1.5 hours. With a persistent Site
group the three cases run one after another, each about 35 to 40 minutes, so a
run takes about 2 hours. Job timeouts set longer failure ceilings.

### Qualify one exact candidate across two Sites

Choose `scenario=fleet` for acceptance of a fleet with mixed AIO releases.
This is separate from the existing `aio` matrix, which deploys one Site. It uses two simultaneous
`ubuntu-24.04` host jobs, each with native K3s and a new Arc registration
in its own owned resource group. One installed Site Ops controller selects
both Sites and makes one deployment with `--parallel 2`. It also checks that
an unselected sentinel Site is excluded.

Use the JSON from the selected release producer's **Exact candidate selection**
summary as `candidate`. Run the workflow
at that same source commit, using a branch or retained tag pointing there.
The selection binds the producer run/attempt, artifact IDs and frozen
digests. Preview candidates remain previews and cannot authorize publication.
The chosen candidate must contain the complete `azure.iot-operations`
workspace. Select the separately approved Azure `environment` and `location`.
Keep the ordinary overrides for one Site empty and leave teardown enabled.

The approved environment supplies `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`,
`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and, when directory lookup is unavailable,
`CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID`. Azure permission must cover creation and deletion of
the new groups, Arc onboarding, AIO deployment and its role assignments.
The test does not create or widen those permissions.

Ephemeral fleet groups use private ownership markers in Azure's immutable
`managedBy` property. Their hashes are retained before creation and checked
before deployment or cleanup. This also applies in a shared subscription,
without a separate allocation service. With `E2E_FLEET_RESOURCE_GROUPS`, the
slots use those persistent groups instead, as described in
[Choose ephemeral or persistent resource groups](#choose-ephemeral-or-persistent-resource-groups).
Each host then connects its cluster in its group's region.

The two configured Sites select AIO `2607` and `2608`, Secret Sync disabled
and the existing E2E Low broker memory profile. Acceptance checks exact Site
identities, operation identities and dispositions, effective AIO release parameters,
the installed engine version, actual deployed extension versions, Kubernetes
instance presence, and readiness of active pods. It does not claim application
data delivery or Secret Sync functionality. Those remain separate scenarios.

#### Runtime and resource budget

Keep capacity for **three simultaneous Linux jobs**: two hosts and the
controller. Resource creation first records an absence/ownership receipt
and uploads it before writes. Afterward, the host/controller startup barrier
allows 15 minutes from that preflight for all three jobs to start, before
provisioning their clusters. A capacity failure releases the host slots
rather than holding them while the controller remains queued.

Installation runs concurrently with host provisioning. All waits consume
one clock started before group creation, rather than restarting a full
allowance at each phase:

| Boundary | Latest elapsed time from ownership preflight |
|---|---|
| All three runner jobs started | 15 minutes |
| Both Arc/K3s hosts ready | 45 minutes |
| Installed deployment and extension version checks | 245 minutes |
| Both Kubernetes readiness observations | 265 minutes |
| Hosts stop waiting for automatic cleanup | 320 minutes |

These are failure ceilings, not predicted durations or sleeps. Commands
finish and release resources as soon as their assertions pass. The deployment
command retains its 150-minute maximum, bounded further by the remaining
shared time. Phase timings appear as fixed messages without identities.
Long waits poll every 30 seconds and retain only their latest metadata
diagnostics. Output and execution of child processes are bounded. If shutdown
cannot be confirmed within its cleanup deadline, the phase stops with an
explicit failure rather than retrying the command or reporting success.

The controller has a 275-minute job cap, cleanup a separate 45-minute cap,
and host jobs a 330-minute cap, below the six hour ceiling for hosted jobs.
The timeline reserves ten minutes after readiness for controller reporting
and 45 minutes for cleanup, with further host shutdown headroom.
Environment approvals and runner queueing are not guaranteed to finish
inside that reserve. The environment must allow approved host, controller
and cleanup jobs to proceed without additional unattended approval stalls.
Missing or late cleanup is a failing or unknown result, never success.

Runs for the same fleet acceptance environment are serialized without
cancelling the active run. Do not start unnecessary concurrent fleet runs
or reduce asserted workloads just to fit a runner. Existing source,
guided cases for one Site, Secret Sync and workload cases remain in their owning
lanes. Select relevant lanes during development and retain all required
candidate coverage before release.

#### Cleanup and interruption

The cleanup job depends on the controller, not on host completion. Hosts
remain alive through readiness and automatic cleanup, then exit. Each
deletion requires the original receipt, its immutable marker commitment and
matching run ownership tags. Cleanup waits until the resource group is confirmed absent.
The final gate requires the controller, both host receipts and cleanup
to identify the same candidate and run. A green wrapper or missing receipt
cannot substitute for that evidence.

Hard workflow cancellation can prevent automatic cleanup. For a separately
approved recovery, choose `scenario=fleet-cleanup` with the same
`candidate`, `original-run` and `original-attempt`.
Reuse the original subscription and environment. Use the original controller
commit, preserving a branch or tag if necessary. Reconciliation recovers
and verifies the original ownership artifact by ID and digest, then checks
resource ownership again. It needs no copy of the private allocation file
and does not regenerate ownership commitments. It refuses an original run
that is still running, including a later attempt of that run. It does not
provision clusters or perform deployments.
Raw Site identities, Site files, kubeconfigs and provider logs are not
uploaded by either mode.

For another attempt, use **Re-run all jobs** or start a new run. Rerunning
only failed jobs stops before any Azure work, because the fleet must pass
within one attempt. Reconcile an earlier attempt whose cleanup did not complete.

### Keep workload phases isolated on one Site

When an `aio` run selects both `dataflow-sample` and `resource-set-samples`, the
test harness removes the first sample's dataflows, profiles, and endpoints
after its module completes. It waits for their projected custom resources to
disappear before the advanced resource set sample starts. A focused run that
selects only one phase preserves that phase's resources for an optional
inspection hold before teardown.

### Check a Windows runner before installer qualification

Choose `scenario=windows-installer-preflight` in a separately approved
**E2E Tests** dispatch to check a fresh `windows-2025` runner. This
diagnostic runs without Azure credentials, a cluster, source checkout or
package installation. It reports only whether WinGet is callable,
whether Python and GitHub CLI are on PATH, and whether the runner
can create a private copied file and file symlink. Missing WinGet or
file link capability fails the job. CI uses file links to exercise symlink
rejection independently of the installation manager.

The default `scenario=aio` keeps the existing Azure E2E behavior.
The Windows diagnostic does not verify a signed script, install tools
through WinGet, or qualify a Site Ops build. These need separate
installation coverage and approval. GitHub-hosted Windows Server runners
run as administrators without UAC, so they do not establish the Windows
desktop experience for a standard user.

The regular PR CI job runs native controls for copied commands, symlink
rejection and unsafe paths, with required symlink capability. Neither Windows check
builds a Site Ops release or claims a verified
engine installation, Azure deployment or a normal Windows desktop session.
Signed bundle installation remains a distinct qualification gate.

No Site file specific to Azure is committed. The E2E Site is rendered at run time from `tests/e2e/sites/e2e-test.yaml.tmpl` into a writable directory and surfaced to the orchestrator via `SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS` (see [Site configuration](site-configuration.md)).

## Modes

| Mode | Resource group | SP scope | When to use |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| ephemeral (default) | Workflow creates and deletes it for each run. | `Owner` at subscription level. | Routine CI validation, fully automated. |
| persistent | Operator supplies an existing RG. Only resources created during the run are deleted (snapshot delta). The cluster itself is always a fresh k3s on the runner. | `Owner` at RG level. | Restricted subscriptions where `Owner` at subscription level is not acceptable. Matrices with several AIO releases are serialized in the shared RG. |

`Owner` is required (not `Contributor`) because AIO deployments make role assignments (for example, schema registry and Key Vault). `Contributor` cannot grant roles.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Azure and OIDC setup

Follow [CI/CD setup - Azure OIDC Configuration](ci-cd-setup.md#azure-oidc-configuration) to create the service principal and federated credential. The SP needs:

- **ephemeral mode:** `Owner` on the subscription.
- **persistent mode:** `Owner` on the selected resource group.

### 2. Custom Locations RP object ID

`connect-arc` uses the Custom Locations RP principal object ID in the tenant. Grab it once per tenant:

```bash
az ad sp list --filter "displayname eq 'Custom Locations RP'" --query "[0].id" -o tsv
```

Store the value in the GitHub Environment as `CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID`. An explicit
`custom-locations-oid` workflow input overrides the secret for one run.

### 3. GitHub Environment and secrets

Create a GitHub Environment (for example, `dev`) and set these secrets:

| Secret | Source | Required |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | App registration client ID | yes |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `az account show --query tenantId -o tsv` | yes |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `az account show --query id -o tsv` | yes |
| `CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID` | Custom Locations RP principal object ID from prerequisite 2 | yes, unless passed as workflow input |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_OID` | `az ad sp show --id <AZURE_CLIENT_ID> --query id -o tsv` | optional |
| `DEBUG_USER_OID` | `az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv` (or a group OID) | optional |

`AZURE_CLIENT_OID` is the SP's directory object ID. The e2e job grants it namespace admin rights on `azure-iot-operations` so kubectl steps that traverse the Arc proxy (e.g. the OPC PLC simulator) succeed. If unset, the workflow falls back to a Microsoft Graph lookup, which requires the SP to have `Directory.Read.All`.

`DEBUG_USER_OID` is a human user (or group) Microsoft Entra object ID. When set, the e2e job binds it to `cluster-admin` on the runner k3s so you can inspect the live cluster via `az connectedk8s proxy -n <cluster> -g <rg>`. Pair with `skip-teardown: true` and/or `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` to keep the cluster around long enough to debug.

```bash
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_ID       --env dev --body "<app-client-id>"
gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID       --env dev --body "$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)"
gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --env dev --body "$(az account show --query id -o tsv)"
gh secret set CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID  --env dev --body "$(az ad sp show --id bc313c14-388c-4e7d-a58e-70017303ee3b --query id -o tsv)"
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_OID      --env dev --body "$(az ad sp show --id <app-client-id> --query id -o tsv)"
gh secret set DEBUG_USER_OID        --env dev --body "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)"
```

## Running in CI

From the **Actions** tab, dispatch **E2E Tests** with the defaults to run one AIO release in ephemeral mode against the `dev` environment:

| Input | Typical value | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `scenario` | `aio` | `aio` runs the AIO matrix described on this page. `release-acceptance` and `site-cleanup` run [release acceptance](#accept-one-release-candidate). `fleet` and `fleet-cleanup` run [fleet qualification](#qualify-one-exact-candidate-across-two-sites). `windows-installer-preflight` runs the [Windows runner check](#check-a-windows-runner-before-installer-qualification). |
| `aio-releases` | `2608` or `2607,2608` | Separated by commas. Ephemeral mode runs them in parallel. Persistent mode serializes cells in the same RG. See [aio-releases.md](aio-releases.md) for how AIO releases are defined and pinned. |
| `environment` | `dev` | GitHub Environment whose secrets/approvers apply. |
| `location` | `eastus2` | ephemeral mode only. Persistent derives from the RG. |
| `resource-group` | empty (ephemeral) or existing RG (persistent) | |
| `cluster-name` | empty | Arc cluster name to register. Generated automatically if empty. |
| `custom-locations-oid` | tenant value | See prerequisite 2. |
| `skip-teardown` | false | Preserve the deployment for inspection. Scope depends on mode (see below). |
| `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` | `0` | Hold the runner for N min before teardown for debugging. Clamped to what is left of the job budget so teardown still runs. Nothing should be added to the persistent RG during the hold (it'll be deleted by teardown). |
| `tests` | empty (run all) or `aio-install,enable-secretsync` | Allowlist of test phases to deploy and run, separated by commas. Valid values: `aio-install`, `enable-secretsync`, `sync-secrets`, `opc-ua-solution`, `dataflow-sample`, `aio-resources`, `resource-set-samples`, `aio-upgrade`. Useful for demos and focused debugging when paired with `keep-cluster-alive-minutes`. |
| `upgrade-to` | empty or `2608` | Optional AIO release to upgrade to after the install phase tests pass. Empty skips the upgrade phase. Each cell skips it when it equals the cell's `aio-releases` value. Requires `aio-upgrade` to be in the `tests` allowlist (or `tests` empty). |
| `secret-sync-modes` | `enabled` or `enabled,disabled` | Matrix modes for Secret Sync and workload identity. Use `enabled,disabled` with `tests=aio-upgrade` to qualify upgrade behavior with and without the OIDC profile. |
| `published-release` | empty or an exact tag | Empty keeps the integration suite that runs from the checkout source. A tag selects the bounded, verified published package mode below. |
| `published-source-sha` | empty or a full commit | Required with `published-release`. Must be the exact commit targeted by the published tag. |
| `published-journey` | `configured` | Applies only with `published-release`. `configured` deploys a configured Site, and `guided` deploys one guided Site. See below. |
| `candidate` | empty | Candidate scenarios use the JSON from the release producer's **Exact candidate selection** summary. With `aio`, it runs the Site cases without the fleet. |
| `original-run`, `original-attempt` | empty | The `fleet-cleanup` and `site-cleanup` scenarios use the original acceptance workflow run ID and attempt. |

Qualify both AIO upgrade optionality paths in one dispatch:

```bash
gh workflow run e2e-test.yaml \
  -f aio-releases=2607 \
  -f upgrade-to=2608 \
  -f tests=aio-upgrade \
  -f secret-sync-modes=enabled,disabled
```

### Qualify a published engine and workspace

Published package mode proves a different boundary from the ordinary source
suite. It does not install `-e .`, import Site Ops from checkout, or use the
checkout workspace as workspace content.

The workflow:

1. Checks the published tag points at the exact supplied `main` commit.
2. Downloads the installation ZIP and detached proof from the current
   repository and compares both with GitHub's published size and SHA-256.
3. Verifies the exact `_siteops-distribution.yaml` signer, `release.yaml`
   caller, source/signer/caller commit, GitHub OIDC issuer, `main` ref and
   `self-hosted` runner class with stock GitHub CLI.
4. Acquires pinned native uv and a separate managed CPython 3.11.16 runtime.
   Controller Python performs verification and preparation only. The
   authenticated bundle helper admits the complete payload, installs without
   an index or source build, and checks the installed bytes. Command and
   module checks require the selected installed engine rather than checkout.
5. Creates an independent workspace signer policy and trusted root snapshot.
6. Before Azure provisioning, renders a complete operator Site outside
   the package, anonymously pins the published IoT Operations workspace into
   that project, confirms pinning did not change the Site and prepares an
   offline `aio-install` plan without compiling.
7. Runs `aio-install` through the same project with package acquisition
   offline, then checks the redacted deployment summary, expected Azure
   resource types, AIO instance custom resource and at least one running,
   Ready operator pod. Completed AIO job pods are not required to become Ready.
8. Uploads only bounded count and status receipts and runs the existing
   persistent teardown of the snapshot delta, preserving the RG that the
   operator supplied.

Published qualification is deliberately bounded:

| Input | Required value |
|---|---|
| `published-release` | Exact approved published tag |
| `published-source-sha` | Exact full source commit |
| `aio-releases` | One AIO release. Guided mode uses `2608`. |
| `tests` | `aio-install` |
| `published-journey` | `configured` or `guided` |
| `secret-sync-modes` | `disabled` for configured Sites. Guided supports `disabled`, `enabled` or both. |
| `resource-group` | Existing dedicated RG |
| `cluster-name` | Empty, so the workflow creates a unique Arc registration. |
| `upgrade-to` | empty |
| `skip-teardown` | `false` |
| `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` | `0` |

The mode snapshots an existing RG, creates a fresh k3s registration connected
to Azure Arc and deploys the selected AIO release. It can incur Azure charges
until cleanup of the snapshot delta completes. The RG itself is preserved. Anything
another actor adds after the snapshot can enter the deletion delta, so use a
dedicated RG and do not make concurrent changes during the run. The mode
establishes the published engine/package deployment route and bounded AIO
readiness observations. They do not establish upgrade behavior, workload
data movement or general production health. A configured disabled cell
does not establish Secret Sync. A guided enabled cell additionally
observes the Secret Provider Class, managed identity, vault, federated
credential and instance binding. The cell compares current RG resource IDs
with its private snapshot from before the run, before selecting resources. It
rejects missing or ambiguous resources that the run owns without publishing
their identities.
Secret Sync infrastructure enablement does not prove secret materialization.

Within the guided disabled cell, the installed engine prepares plans from a
resource ID, a manual file and inline inputs, using the verified package.
The manual and inline routes do not authorize a cluster resource read. A
complete manual Site is also saved to the operator project and planned with a
bounded selector for configured Sites. The cell compares the selected Site and
operation identities and dispositions in private runner files, then deploys
only the Site built from the resource ID. These additional preparations do not
prove identical parameter bytes, a second deployment, or live readiness for
the other input routes.

Example guided qualification in one dedicated existing RG. Supply an
approved published tag and its exact full main commit before running:

```bash
gh workflow run e2e-test.yaml \
  --ref main \
  -f published-release=<approved-published-release> \
  -f published-source-sha=<full-main-commit> \
  -f aio-releases=2608 \
  -f resource-group=<dedicated-existing-rg> \
  -f published-journey=guided \
  -f tests=aio-install \
  -f secret-sync-modes=disabled,enabled
```

### What `skip-teardown` leaves behind

| Mode | Normal teardown | With `skip-teardown: true` |
|------|----------------|----------------------------|
| ephemeral | `az group delete` on the RG that the workflow created. | **Entire RG and every resource inside it persist.** You are responsible for deleting the RG afterwards. Otherwise orphan RGs accumulate and bill indefinitely. |
| persistent | `az connectedk8s delete` (only if the Arc cluster was created by this run) + deletion of the snapshot delta, the resources created during the run. RG itself is never touched. | Arc cluster + resources created by this run persist inside the operator's RG. Anything that existed before the run is untouched in either case. |

### Teardown safety guarantees

Ephemeral teardown runs three independent guards before `az group delete`. Any single mismatch fails the step rather than proceeding:

1. **Name pattern.** RG must match `rg-e2e-<run_id>-<run_attempt>-*` built from the **current** workflow run, not a generic prefix. An existing RG named `rg-e2e-...` from another run cannot pass.
2. **Tag provenance.** RG must carry `managedBy=siteops-e2e`, `ephemeral=true`, `run_id=<this run>`, `run_attempt=<this attempt>`. Tags are written by the `Create resource group (ephemeral mode)` step and are never applied by the persistent path, so an RG that an operator supplies cannot accidentally carry them.
3. **Existence.** A missing RG is treated as idempotent success (not failure), so reruns after manual cleanup do not fail spuriously.

Persistent teardown deletes the Arc cluster only if it was not present in the snapshot taken before the run (only clusters this run registered). A cluster with the same name that an operator owns is preserved. Resource deletion is bounded to the snapshot delta (after minus before): the workflow records every resource ID present in the RG before it creates anything in Azure and deletes only what was added during the run. Missing snapshot → skip delta cleanup (manual inspection). Enumeration failure after the run → emit an error instead of declaring the RG clean.

**Use a dedicated RG for persistent mode.** Anything added to the RG between the snapshot and teardown (by operators, automation, or a `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` hold) appears in the delta and is deleted.

Names that the operator supplies are masked before step environments can
display them. Persistent runs serialize on a concurrency key that ignores
case and does not contain the resource group name. For the published persistent snapshot and
teardown, public logs and summaries report fixed reasons and aggregate counts.
Those steps keep resource ID lists and provider diagnostics in private runner
files. The published Arc connection also keeps provider diagnostics on the
runner instead of printing arbitrary errors publicly. These files are not
uploaded and disappear with the runner.
When cleanup reports an incomplete or unknown result, inspect the dedicated
RG privately through an authorized Azure inventory. A successful cleanup
step is not an independent RG inventory check.

A JUnit XML artifact is uploaded for each source mode matrix cell
(`e2e-results-<release>-secretsync-<mode>.xml`). When `upgrade-to` is set and
the cell exercises the upgrade phase, a second artifact
(`e2e-results-<release>-to-<upgrade-to>-secretsync-<mode>.xml`) is uploaded
with the results of the upgrade tests. Published package mode instead uploads
only `published-deployment.json` and `published-readiness.json`. They contain
public release identities and aggregate counts, not Azure resource IDs.

## Running locally

Local runs use your own k3s cluster (or any cluster connected to Azure Arc) and your own subscription. The renderer is Python and runs on any platform. No `envsubst` or bash required.

Set the required variables. The renderer fills in defaults for the optional ones.

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP` | yes | n/a |
| `E2E_CLUSTER_NAME` | yes | n/a |
| `E2E_AIO_RELEASE` | yes | n/a |
| `E2E_SITE_NAME` | no | `e2e-local-<unix_time>` |
| `E2E_SUBSCRIPTION` | no | `az account show --query id -o tsv` |
| `E2E_LOCATION` | no | `az group show -n $E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP --query location -o tsv` |
| `E2E_ENABLE_SECRET_SYNC` | no | `true` |

### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
$env:E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP = "rg-e2e-dev"
$env:E2E_CLUSTER_NAME   = "arc-e2e-dev"
$env:E2E_AIO_RELEASE    = "2608"
$env:E2E_SITE_NAME      = "e2e-local-$([DateTimeOffset]::Now.ToUnixTimeSeconds())"

$sitesDir = Join-Path $env:TEMP "e2e-sites"
python scripts/render-e2e-site.py --output-dir $sitesDir

$env:SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS = $sitesDir
$env:INTEGRATION_SELECTOR     = "name=$env:E2E_SITE_NAME"

pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration
```

### bash (Linux / macOS / WSL)

```bash
export E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP=rg-e2e-dev
export E2E_CLUSTER_NAME=arc-e2e-dev
export E2E_AIO_RELEASE=2608
export E2E_SITE_NAME="e2e-local-$(date +%s)"

SITES_DIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/e2e-sites"
python scripts/render-e2e-site.py --output-dir "$SITES_DIR"

export SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS="$SITES_DIR"
export INTEGRATION_SELECTOR="name=$E2E_SITE_NAME"

pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration
```

Setting `E2E_SITE_NAME` explicitly (or letting the renderer default to `e2e-local-<unix_time>`) gives you a predictable Site name up front. The renderer also writes the file as `<E2E_SITE_NAME>.yaml` so the filename matches the Site's `name:` field (the standard Site Ops convention).

You must already be logged in (`az login`) and have the cluster registered with Arc. The workflow automates these steps but local runs assume your cluster is already connected to Azure Arc.

### Running upgrade phase tests locally

To exercise an upgrade between AIO releases locally, install at one AIO release first (block above), then render the Site again at the release you upgrade to and run the upgrade test classes:

```bash
# Re-render with the upgrade target. Same E2E_SITE_NAME so the file overwrites in place.
export E2E_AIO_RELEASE=2608
python scripts/render-e2e-site.py --output-dir "$SITES_DIR"

export SITEOPS_E2E_UPGRADE_PHASE=1
pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration
```

`SITEOPS_E2E_UPGRADE_PHASE=1` does two things:

- **Narrows test collection** to `_UPGRADE_PHASE_ALLOWED_CLASSES` in `tests/integration/conftest.py`. Classes whose assertions require outputs from the install phase are listed in `_UPGRADE_PHASE_INSTALL_ONLY_CLASSES` instead. A workspace test requires every class in the upgrade module to appear in exactly one collection.
- **Bypasses the `aio_install_result` fixture** so `aio-install` is not deployed again at the new AIO release on top of the existing instance.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `azure/login` fails with `AADSTS70021` | Federated credential `sub` claim mismatch. | Confirm the credential matches `repo:<org>/<repo>:environment:<env>` (or branch ref) exactly. See [CI/CD setup](ci-cd-setup.md#azure-oidc-configuration). |
| Pytest collects 0 integration tests | Selector does not match the rendered Site, or `SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS` is unset. | Check `INTEGRATION_SELECTOR` equals the rendered Site's `name:` field. |
| Rendered output still contains `${...}` | Template references a variable not in `ALL_VARS`. | Add it to `REQUIRED_VARS` or `OPTIONAL_VARS` in `scripts/render-e2e-site.py`. |
| AIO deploy fails with `AuthorizationFailed` on role assignment | SP is `Contributor`, not `Owner`. | Escalate to `Owner` on sub (ephemeral) or RG (persistent). |
| Teardown in persistent mode leaves resources | The snapshot step failed or was skipped. | Inspect the step summary warning and the `Snapshot RG resources (persistent mode)` step log. Clean up residual resources manually. |
| Step summary shows `Persistent-mode teardown incomplete (N residual resource(s))` | One or more delta deletes did not converge in 5 retry passes. | Inspect the `[delete-failed pass=*]` warnings in the teardown step log. Clean up the named resources manually. For a connectedCluster, use `az connectedk8s delete -n <name> -g <rg> --yes --force`. |
| connect-arc times out waiting for `Connected` | Arc registration or heartbeat did not reach `Connected`. Authentication, cluster reachability, or custom locations configuration may be involved. | Verify prerequisite 2. Rerun with `skip-teardown: true` and inspect `az connectedk8s show` from an authorized local session. |
