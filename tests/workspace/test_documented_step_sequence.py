"""Tests that a manifest's documented step sequence matches what it deploys.

Several manifests list their post-flatten step sequence in the `description:`
field, so a reader can see the order without running `siteops plan --describe`. That
listing is hand-maintained and has no other guard, which makes it the first thing
to go stale when includes are added or removed.

The check is opt-in by convention: a manifest participates by writing a
"Post-flatten step sequence" block of numbered lines. A manifest without one is
skipped, so this never forces the documentation on anyone.
