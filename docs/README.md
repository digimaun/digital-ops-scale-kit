## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Workspace** | A directory, often under `workspaces/`, containing `sites/`, `manifests/`, `parameters/`, and `templates/`, plus optional `contracts/`, `samples/`, and `sites.local/`. |
| **Site** | A deployment target (`kind: Site`). Has subscription, optional resource group, location, labels, parameters, properties. |
| **SiteTemplate** | A reusable site base (`kind: SiteTemplate`). Cannot be deployed directly. Referenced via `inherits:`. |
| **Manifest** | A `kind: Manifest` YAML defining ordered steps and parameters. It may name sites, select them by label, or defer targeting to the CLI. |
| **Selector** | A label expression (`key=value,key=value`) that filters sites. Set on a manifest as `selector:` or via the CLI `--selector` / `-l` flag. See [targeting.md](targeting.md). |
| **Inheritance** | Single-parent merge for sites. A site `inherits:` from a SiteTemplate. Child overrides parent on conflict. Nested objects merge recursively. |
| **Overlay** | A same-name site file in `sites.local/` (or an extras dir) that merges into a base site at load time. Cannot introduce `inherits:` or rename the site. |
| **Include** | A step shape that splices another manifest's steps into the parent's step list at the include's position. Optionally gated by `when:`. |
| **Standalone manifest** | A manifest meant to be deployed directly. The default. |
| **Partial** | A manifest authored to be `include:`-d, not deployed standalone. Filename prefixed `_` by convention. |
| **Sample** | A deployable example in `samples/<name>/`. Two shapes are supported, split by whether other samples can compose it: bundles (carry a `_partial.yaml`, so other samples can compose them) and compositions (`include:` other partials instead). |
| **Composition** | A sample that carries no `_partial.yaml`, so it is an endpoint rather than a building block. Its `manifest.yaml` is built from `include:` steps pulling in `_partial.yaml`s from `manifests/` and other samples, plus any glue step they need and any declaration files it attaches. |
| **Declaration** | An operator-authored parameter file describing values or resources to apply, such as a `secrets` array or the asset catalog's `devices` and `assets`. It attaches at manifest level. Ordinary values remain overridable through `site.parameters`. Composed resource collections change by selecting different resource sets. |
| **Resource catalog** | The workspace library of reusable AIO resource definitions. `manifests/aio-resources.yaml` composes the sets each site selects. See [resource-catalog.md](resource-catalog.md). |
| **Resource area** | A public selection axis under `properties.resourceSets`, such as `devices`, `assets`, or `dataflows`. Several areas may share one internal deployment step. |
| **Deployment family** | An internal group of related resource kinds deployed as one step, such as Device Registry devices and assets, or dataflow endpoints, profiles, and dataflows. |
| **Resource set** | A named YAML source containing resource definitions or advanced composition metadata. Sites compose ordered sets through `properties.resourceSets.<area>`. Deselecting a set does not delete resources. |
| **Step** | A unit of work in a manifest's `steps:` list. Shapes: Bicep deploy (`template:`), kubectl op (`type: kubectl`), wait gate (`type: wait`), include (`include:`). |
| **Scope** | A step's deployment scope: `resourceGroup` or `subscription`. |
| **AIO release** | A versioned bundle of pinned extension versions and API versions, defined by a YAML in `parameters/aio-releases/` and selected per site via `properties.aioRelease`. |
| **Auto-filtering** | Executable preparation omits parameter keys the template does not declare, then requires non-nullable parameters that have no default. |
| **Chaining** | Wiring a step's outputs into a downstream step's parameters via `{{ steps.X.outputs.Y }}`. |
| **Dispatcher** | A Bicep template that switches on an API-version param into per-API-version inner modules under `templates/<area>/modules/`. |
