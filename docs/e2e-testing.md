# E2E Testing

End-to-end (E2E) tests exercise selected Scale Kit scenarios in a live Azure
subscription. A workflow matrix cell creates a fresh k3s cluster, registers it
with Azure Arc, deploys Azure IoT Operations through Site Ops, and runs the
selected integration tests. Ephemeral mode normally deletes its resource
group. Persistent mode removes resources in the run's snapshot delta, and
`skip-teardown` preserves them for inspection.

A passing cell establishes only the assertions selected for that release,
mode, and test allowlist. It does not certify an arbitrary cluster, AIO
installation, or workload as ready for production. These runs create Azure
resources and can incur charges until teardown completes.

Use E2E tests when:

- Validating a PR that changes orchestration, merge, or deployment logic.
- Qualifying a new AIO release before updating workspace defaults.
- Reproducing a field issue end-to-end against a real subscription.

Unit tests (`pytest tests/ -m "not integration"`) cover local engine,
workspace, and workflow behavior and should remain the default pre-commit
gate. E2E is intentionally opt-in (`workflow_dispatch`).

When one run selects both `dataflow-sample` and `resource-set-samples`, the
test harness removes the first sample's dataflows, profiles, and endpoints
after its module completes. It waits for their projected custom resources to
disappear before the advanced resource-set sample starts. A focused run that
selects only one phase preserves that phase's resources for an optional
pre-teardown inspection hold.

```

No Azure-specific site file is committed. The E2E site is rendered at run time from `tests/e2e/sites/e2e-test.yaml.tmpl` into a writable directory and surfaced to the orchestrator via `SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS` (see [Site configuration](site-configuration.md)).

## Modes

| Mode | Resource group | SP scope | When to use |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| ephemeral (default) | Workflow creates and deletes per run. | Subscription-level `Owner`. | Routine CI validation, fully automated. |
| persistent | Operator supplies a pre-existing RG. Only resources created during the run are deleted (snapshot delta). The cluster itself is always a fresh k3s on the runner (bring-your-own-cluster is not supported). | RG-level `Owner`. | Restricted subscriptions where sub-level Owner is not acceptable. Multi-release matrices are serialized in the shared RG. |

`Owner` is required (not `Contributor`) because AIO deployments make role assignments (for example, schema registry and Key Vault). `Contributor` cannot grant roles.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Azure and OIDC setup

Follow [CI/CD setup - Azure OIDC Configuration](ci-cd-setup.md#azure-oidc-configuration) to create the service principal and federated credential. The SP needs:

- **ephemeral mode:** `Owner` on the subscription.
- **persistent mode:** `Owner` on the target resource group.

### 2. Custom Locations RP object ID

`connect-arc` uses the Custom Locations RP principal object ID in the tenant. Grab it once per tenant:

```bash
az ad sp list --filter "displayname eq 'Custom Locations RP'" --query "[0].id" -o tsv
```

Store the value in the GitHub Environment as `CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID`. An explicit
`custom-locations-oid` workflow input overrides the secret for one run.

### 3. GitHub Environment and secrets

Create a GitHub Environment (for example, `dev`) and set these secrets:

| Secret | Source | Required |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | App registration client ID | yes |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `az account show --query tenantId -o tsv` | yes |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `az account show --query id -o tsv` | yes |
| `CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID` | Custom Locations RP principal object ID from prerequisite 2 | yes, unless passed as workflow input |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_OID` | `az ad sp show --id <AZURE_CLIENT_ID> --query id -o tsv` | optional |
| `DEBUG_USER_OID` | `az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv` (or a group OID) | optional |

`AZURE_CLIENT_OID` is the SP's directory object ID. The e2e job binds it to namespace-admin on `azure-iot-operations` so kubectl steps that traverse the Arc proxy (e.g. the OPC PLC simulator) succeed. If unset, the workflow falls back to a Microsoft Graph lookup, which requires the SP to have `Directory.Read.All`.

`DEBUG_USER_OID` is a human user (or group) AAD object ID. When set, the e2e job binds it to `cluster-admin` on the runner k3s so you can inspect the live cluster via `az connectedk8s proxy -n <cluster> -g <rg>`. Pair with `skip-teardown: true` and/or `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` to keep the cluster around long enough to debug.

```bash
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_ID       --env dev --body "<app-client-id>"
gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID       --env dev --body "$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)"
gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --env dev --body "$(az account show --query id -o tsv)"
gh secret set CUSTOM_LOCATIONS_OID  --env dev --body "$(az ad sp show --id bc313c14-388c-4e7d-a58e-70017303ee3b --query id -o tsv)"
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_OID      --env dev --body "$(az ad sp show --id <app-client-id> --query id -o tsv)"
gh secret set DEBUG_USER_OID        --env dev --body "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)"
```

## Running in CI

From the **Actions** tab, dispatch **E2E Tests** with the defaults to run a single-release ephemeral-mode pass against the `dev` environment:

| Input | Typical value | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `aio-releases` | `2608` or `2607,2608` | Comma-separated. Ephemeral fans out in parallel. Persistent serializes cells in the same RG. See [aio-releases.md](aio-releases.md) for how releases are defined and pinned. |
| `environment` | `dev` | GitHub Environment whose secrets/approvers apply. |
| `location` | `eastus2` | ephemeral mode only. Persistent derives from the RG. |
| `resource-group` | empty (ephemeral) or existing RG (persistent) | |
| `cluster-name` | empty | Arc cluster name to register. auto-generated if empty. |
| `custom-locations-oid` | tenant value | See prerequisite 2. |
| `skip-teardown` | false | Preserve the deployment for inspection. Scope depends on mode (see below). |
| `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` | `0` | Hold the runner for N min before teardown for debugging. Clamped to what is left of the job budget so teardown still runs. Nothing should be added to the persistent RG during the hold (it'll be deleted by teardown). |
| `tests` | empty (run all) or `aio-install,enable-secretsync` | Comma-separated allowlist of test phases to deploy and run. Valid values: `aio-install`, `enable-secretsync`, `sync-secrets`, `opc-ua-solution`, `dataflow-sample`, `aio-resources`, `resource-set-samples`, `aio-upgrade`. Useful for demos and focused debugging when paired with `keep-cluster-alive-minutes`. |
| `upgrade-to` | empty or `2608` | Optional AIO release to upgrade to after install-phase tests pass. Empty skips the upgrade phase. Per-cell skip when equal to the cell's `aio-releases` value. Requires `aio-upgrade` to be in the `tests` allowlist (or `tests` empty). |
| `secret-sync-modes` | `enabled` or `enabled,disabled` | Matrix modes for Secret Sync and workload identity. Use `enabled,disabled` with `tests=aio-upgrade` to qualify upgrade behavior with and without the OIDC profile. |
| `published-release` | empty or an exact tag | Empty keeps the checkout-source integration suite. A tag selects the bounded verified published-package mode below. |
| `published-source-sha` | empty or a full commit | Required with `published-release`. Must be the exact commit targeted by the published tag. |

Qualify both AIO upgrade optionality paths in one dispatch:

```bash
gh workflow run e2e-test.yaml \
  -f aio-releases=2607 \
  -f upgrade-to=2608 \
  -f tests=aio-upgrade \
  -f secret-sync-modes=enabled,disabled
```

### Qualify a published engine and workspace

Published-package mode proves a different boundary from the ordinary source
suite. It does not install `-e .`, import Site Ops from checkout, or use the
checkout workspace as deployment content.

The workflow:

1. Checks the published tag targets the exact supplied `main` commit.
2. Downloads the installation ZIP and detached proof from the current
   repository and compares both with GitHub's published size and SHA-256.
3. Verifies the exact `_siteops-distribution.yaml` signer, `release.yaml`
   caller, source/signer/caller commit, GitHub OIDC issuer, `main` ref and
   `self-hosted` runner class with stock GitHub CLI.
4. Provisions pipx 1.17.2 and its hash-pinned pip 26.2.1 backend, installs the
   authenticated `pylock.toml` with no index or source build, then rejects any
   Site Ops import rooted in checkout.
5. Creates an independent workspace signer policy and trusted-root snapshot.
6. Before Azure provisioning, renders a self-contained operator Site outside
   the package, anonymously pins the published IoT Operations workspace into
   that project, confirms pinning did not change the Site and prepares an
   offline compile-free `aio-install` plan.
7. Runs `aio-install` through the same project with package acquisition
   offline, then checks the redacted deployment summary, expected Azure
   resource types, AIO instance custom resource and at least one running,
   Ready operator pod. Completed AIO job pods are not required to become Ready.
8. Uploads only bounded count/status receipts and runs the existing
   provenance-guarded ephemeral RG teardown.

This first slice is deliberately constrained:

| Input | Required value |
|---|---|
| `published-release` | Exact approved published tag |
| `published-source-sha` | Exact full source commit |
| `aio-releases` | One release, normally `2608` |
| `tests` | `aio-install` |
| `secret-sync-modes` | `disabled` |
| `resource-group` / `cluster-name` | empty |
| `upgrade-to` | empty |
| `skip-teardown` | `false` |
| `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` | `0` |

The mode creates a fresh ephemeral RG and Arc-connected k3s cluster, deploys
the selected AIO release and can incur Azure charges until deletion completes.
It establishes the published engine/package deployment route and bounded AIO
readiness observations. It does not establish Secret Sync, upgrade, workload
data movement or general production health.

Example:

```bash
gh workflow run e2e-test.yaml \
  --ref <reviewed-branch> \
  -f published-release=v0.0.4.dev20260919 \
  -f published-source-sha=<full-main-commit> \
  -f aio-releases=2608 \
  -f tests=aio-install \
  -f secret-sync-modes=disabled
```

### What `skip-teardown` leaves behind

| Mode | Normal teardown | With `skip-teardown: true` |
|------|----------------|----------------------------|
| ephemeral | `az group delete` on the workflow-created RG. | **Entire RG and every resource inside it persist.** You are responsible for deleting the RG afterwards. Otherwise orphan RGs accumulate and bill indefinitely. |
| persistent | `az connectedk8s delete` (only if the Arc cluster was created by this run) + snapshot-delta deletion of resources created during the run. RG itself is never touched. | Arc cluster + resources created by this run persist inside the operator's RG. Anything that existed before the run is untouched in either case. |

### Teardown safety guarantees

Ephemeral teardown runs three independent guards before `az group delete`. Any single mismatch hard-fails the step rather than proceeding:

1. **Name pattern.** RG must match `rg-e2e-<run_id>-<run_attempt>-*` built from the **current** workflow run, not a generic prefix. A pre-existing RG named `rg-e2e-...` from another run cannot pass.
2. **Tag provenance.** RG must carry `managedBy=siteops-e2e`, `ephemeral=true`, `run_id=<this run>`, `run_attempt=<this attempt>`. Tags are written by the `Create resource group` step and are never applied by the persistent path, so an operator-supplied RG cannot accidentally carry them.
3. **Existence.** A missing RG is treated as idempotent success (not failure), so reruns after manual cleanup do not fail spuriously.

Persistent teardown deletes the Arc cluster only if it was not present in the pre-run snapshot (i.e. only clusters this run registered). An operator-owned cluster with the same name is preserved. Resource deletion is bounded to the snapshot delta (post − pre): the workflow records every resource ID present in the RG before any Azure-side creation and deletes only what was added during the run. Missing snapshot → skip delta cleanup (manual inspection). Post-run enumeration failure → emit an error instead of declaring the RG clean.

**Use a dedicated RG for persistent mode.** Anything added to the RG between the snapshot and teardown (by operators, automation, or a `keep-cluster-alive-minutes` hold) appears in the delta and is deleted.

A JUnit XML artifact is uploaded per source-mode matrix cell
(`e2e-results-<release>-secretsync-<mode>.xml`). When `upgrade-to` is set and
the cell exercises the upgrade phase, a second artifact
(`e2e-results-<release>-to-<upgrade-to>-secretsync-<mode>.xml`) is uploaded
with the upgrade-only test results. Published-package mode instead uploads
only `published-deployment.json` and `published-readiness.json`; they contain
public release identities and aggregate counts, not Azure resource IDs.

## Running locally

Local runs target your own k3s (or any Arc-connected) cluster against your own subscription. The renderer is cross-platform Python. No `envsubst` or bash required.

Set three required env vars. Three more are auto-computed on first use.

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP` | yes | n/a |
| `E2E_CLUSTER_NAME` | yes | n/a |
| `E2E_AIO_RELEASE` | yes | n/a |
| `E2E_SITE_NAME` | no | `e2e-local-<unix_time>` |
| `E2E_SUBSCRIPTION` | no | `az account show --query id -o tsv` |
| `E2E_LOCATION` | no | `az group show -n $E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP --query location -o tsv` |
| `E2E_ENABLE_SECRET_SYNC` | no | `true` |

### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
$env:E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP = "rg-e2e-dev"
$env:E2E_CLUSTER_NAME   = "arc-e2e-dev"
$env:E2E_AIO_RELEASE    = "2608"
$env:E2E_SITE_NAME      = "e2e-local-$([DateTimeOffset]::Now.ToUnixTimeSeconds())"

$sitesDir = Join-Path $env:TEMP "e2e-sites"
python scripts/render-e2e-site.py --output-dir $sitesDir

$env:SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS = $sitesDir
$env:INTEGRATION_SELECTOR     = "name=$env:E2E_SITE_NAME"

pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration
```

### bash (Linux / macOS / WSL)

```bash
export E2E_RESOURCE_GROUP=rg-e2e-dev
export E2E_CLUSTER_NAME=arc-e2e-dev
export E2E_AIO_RELEASE=2608
export E2E_SITE_NAME="e2e-local-$(date +%s)"

SITES_DIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/e2e-sites"
python scripts/render-e2e-site.py --output-dir "$SITES_DIR"

export SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS="$SITES_DIR"
export INTEGRATION_SELECTOR="name=$E2E_SITE_NAME"

pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration
```

Setting `E2E_SITE_NAME` explicitly (or letting the renderer default to `e2e-local-<unix_time>`) gives you a predictable site name up front. The renderer also writes the file as `<E2E_SITE_NAME>.yaml` so the filename matches the site's `name:` field (the standard siteops convention).

You must already be logged in (`az login`) and have the cluster registered with Arc. The workflow automates these steps but local runs assume you already have an Arc-enabled target.

### Running upgrade-phase tests locally

To exercise the cross-release upgrade locally, install at one release first (block above), then re-render the site at the upgrade target and run the upgrade-only test classes:

```bash
# Re-render with the upgrade target. Same E2E_SITE_NAME so the file overwrites in place.
export E2E_AIO_RELEASE=2608
python scripts/render-e2e-site.py --output-dir "$SITES_DIR"

export SITEOPS_E2E_UPGRADE_PHASE=1
pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration
```

`SITEOPS_E2E_UPGRADE_PHASE=1` does two things:

- **Narrows test collection** to `_UPGRADE_PHASE_ALLOWED_CLASSES` in `tests/integration/conftest.py`. Classes whose assertions require install-phase outputs are listed in `_UPGRADE_PHASE_INSTALL_ONLY_CLASSES` instead. A workspace test requires every class in the upgrade module to appear in exactly one collection.
- **Short-circuits the `aio_install_result` fixture** so `aio-install` is not re-deployed at the new release on top of the existing instance.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `azure/login` fails with `AADSTS70021` | Federated credential `sub` claim mismatch. | Confirm the credential matches `repo:<org>/<repo>:environment:<env>` (or branch ref) exactly. See [CI/CD setup](ci-cd-setup.md#azure-oidc-configuration). |
| Pytest collects 0 integration tests | Selector does not match the rendered site, or `SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS` is unset. | Check `INTEGRATION_SELECTOR` equals the rendered site's `name:` field. |
| Rendered output still contains `${...}` | Template references a variable not in `ALL_VARS`. | Add it to `REQUIRED_VARS` or `OPTIONAL_VARS` in `scripts/render-e2e-site.py`. |
| AIO deploy fails with `AuthorizationFailed` on role assignment | SP is `Contributor`, not `Owner`. | Escalate to `Owner` on sub (ephemeral) or RG (persistent). |
| Persistent-mode teardown leaves resources | The snapshot step failed or was skipped. | Inspect the step summary warning and the `Snapshot RG resources` step log. Clean up residual resources manually. |
| Step summary shows `incomplete in RG ... (N residual resource(s))` | One or more delta deletes did not converge in 5 retry passes. | Inspect the `[delete-failed pass=*]` warnings in the teardown step log. Clean up the named resources manually. For a connectedCluster, use `az connectedk8s delete -n <name> -g <rg> --yes --force`. |
| connect-arc times out waiting for `Connected` | Arc registration or heartbeat did not reach `Connected`. Authentication, cluster reachability, or custom-locations configuration may be involved. | Verify prerequisite 2. Re-run with `skip-teardown: true` and inspect `az connectedk8s show` from an authorized local session. |
