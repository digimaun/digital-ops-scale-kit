# dataflow-sample

Reference sample that declares dataflows in YAML and deploys them onto an existing AIO instance. It carries no Bicep of its own. `dataflows.yaml` is the whole declaration, and the shared catalog templates under `templates/aio/dataflows/` deploy it.

Compare this directory with `../opc-ua-solution/`, which expresses its dataflow as ARM resources in `template.bicep`. Both approaches are supported, and both deploy the same kind of resource.

## What this sample deploys

1. **resolve-aio**: reads the custom location name from the existing AIO instance.
2. **dataflow-resources**: everything `dataflows.yaml` declares, in one deployment.
   - two MQTT endpoints (`dataflow-sample-mqtt-out`, `dataflow-sample-alerts-out`) pointing at the local AIO broker
   - two execution pools (`dataflow-sample-profile`, `dataflow-sample-alerts-pool`) so neither path shares the default pool
   - two dataflows. `dataflow-sample-passthrough` subscribes to every asset topic under `azure-iot-operations/data/`, passes each message through, and republishes it. `dataflow-sample-alerts` reads the narrower `azure-iot-operations/data/alerts/` prefix through its own pool and its own endpoint.

Each key is a list, so all six resources come from one file and deploy in a single round trip. Adding a seventh is adding a list entry, not adding a step. Nothing in this sample is a template.

### Per-site values

The declaration reads site values, so one committed file gives every site its own topics and its own broker client id:

- destination topics carry `{{ site.labels.country }}`, `{{ site.labels.city }}`, and `{{ site.name }}`, so a central subscriber can tell sites apart
- each endpoint sets `clientIdPrefix` from `{{ site.name }}`, which resolves two levels below `properties`

A site value resolves at any depth in a declaration. Use one every target site carries. A site that leaves a `{{ ... }}` unresolved fails the step before it deploys. `tests/workspace/test_catalog_gating.py` checks every committed definition against every committed site earlier in CI.

## Prerequisites

- AIO must be installed on the target cluster. Run `aio-install` first.
- The site's `aioRelease` must point to a release config under `parameters/aio-releases/`.

The deployment creates no supporting cloud service outside the existing AIO
instance and uses the normal Site Ops deployment identity. Exercising the data
path separately requires an authenticated in-cluster MQTT client.

## Seeing data move

A successful deployment provisions the dataflow resources but does not
establish dataflow health or data movement. A stock AIO install has no assets,
so use one of these routes to give the dataflows something to carry:

- **Deploy `samples/opc-ua-solution/manifest.yaml` first.** It brings up a simulated OPC UA server, a device, and an oven asset publishing under `azure-iot-operations/data/`, which this dataflow's source subscribes to. Both samples deploy against the same existing AIO install, so running them in sequence is all it takes. On release `2607` the MQTT client below is the quickest route, for the reason [that sample's README](../opc-ua-solution/README.md#releases-this-data-path-reaches) gives.
- **Publish a message yourself** with an in-cluster MQTT client (see Microsoft's [`mqtt-client.yaml` reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-operations/manage-mqtt-broker/howto-test-connection)), targeting a topic under `azure-iot-operations/data/`, and subscribe to `dataflow-sample/<country>/<site>/output` to watch it arrive.

`dataflow-sample-alerts` reads the narrower `azure-iot-operations/data/alerts/#`, which neither route publishes to, so it stays idle until something publishes under that prefix. Publish there to exercise it, and subscribe to `dataflow-sample/alerts/<city>/<site>`.

## Configure before deploying

Edit `dataflows.yaml` for this one-off sample. Composed resource arrays are
owned by manifest-level definition sources, so `site.parameters` and step
parameter files cannot replace them. The endpoint host and trust bundle name in
`dataflows.yaml` assume an install in the default `azure-iot-operations`
namespace. Adjust both when the install uses a different namespace.

## Deploy

```bash
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy samples/dataflow-sample/manifest.yaml -l environment=dev
```

The dataflow carries whatever assets publish. For real telemetry through it, deploy `samples/opc-ua-solution/manifest.yaml` first to bring up a simulated asset, then deploy this sample.

## Sharing a declaration across sites

This sample keeps its declaration next to itself. A fleet usually wants the opposite: one declaration shared by every site of a class. Move the file to `parameters/dataflows/<set>.yaml`, point sites at it, and deploy `manifests/aio-resources.yaml`:

```yaml
# sites/<site>.yaml
properties:
  resourceSets:
    dataflows:
      - my-set
```

The declaration is unchanged by the move. Only its location and the manifest that attaches it differ. See `docs/resource-catalog.md`.

## Verifying the result

Check the dataflow reached the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get dataflows.connectivity.iotoperations.azure.com -n azure-iot-operations
kubectl get dataflowendpoints.connectivity.iotoperations.azure.com -n azure-iot-operations
```

## Removing the sample

The Bicep deploy is incremental, so removing a declaration from `dataflows.yaml` and redeploying leaves the resource in place. Delete it explicitly:

```bash
az resource delete --ids <dataflowResourceId> <endpointResourceId> <profileResourceId>
```

## Writing your own sample

See `../README.md` for sample conventions and how to add a new sample to this workspace.
