# AKS Edge Essentials upgrade (host-ops)

In-place upgrade of an existing single-node AKS Edge Essentials cluster,
delivered remotely from Azure via an Arc Run Command. It mirrors the host
bootstrap's runCommand-worker pattern because AKS EE has no cloud-driven upgrade
channel: the only way to drive an upgrade remotely is to invoke the on-box
PowerShell cmdlets, which this worker does, wrapped with idempotency, a
pre-upgrade snapshot, a mandatory verification gate, and a completion tag.

For how the runCommand-worker pattern works (the launcher, the phase state
machine, the managed-identity auth, and the tag gate), see the bootstrap README
at [`../../host-bootstrap/aksee/README.md`](../../host-bootstrap/aksee/README.md).

## Scope

Two upgrade modes are supported, selected by `allowKubernetesMinorUpgrade` under
`deployOptions` in the site config. The mode toggle is a property, while the
optional `targetKubernetesVersion` that bounds a minor-mode run is a value under
`parameters.aksee`:

**Patch mode** (default, `false`): applies AKS EE patch updates within the
current Kubernetes minor version on a single-node cluster. `AcceptUpgrade`
stays false throughout.

**Minor mode** (`true`): performs sequential multi-hop upgrades, advancing one
Kubernetes minor version per hop (e.g. k3s 1.31 -> 1.32 -> 1.33). Each hop
runs the full stage/apply/verify cycle. `AcceptUpgrade` is set true for the
run. Successful finalization attempts to re-pin it false. A failed run leaves
it set so the staged update-cache survives for a re-deploy to resume.

Set `site.parameters.aksee.targetKubernetesVersion` (e.g. `"1.33"`) to stop at
a specific minor version. Leave it empty to upgrade to the latest available
version (up to the 6-hop maximum).

The worker verifies the cluster after each hop and attempts to report the
outcome through the completion tag:

- The node-VM update can intermittently fail to finalize (the node cannot find
  `/EFI/AZLB/bootx64.efi` after it reboots). The worker surfaces this as the tag
  value `failed-needs-remediation`. The fix is a manual VM-console step (see
  [Trident remediation](#trident-remediation)).
- The worker re-checks node health and the Arc connection after the update and
  fails the deploy if either regressed.

AIO health is not verified by the worker. Confirm AIO after the upgrade if the
cluster runs it.

## How it works

The upgrade is delivered as a `Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/runCommands`
resource that inlines the minified launcher. The Connected Machine Agent runs
the launcher, which registers a Scheduled Task running as
`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, then returns `REGISTERED`. The worker runs
asynchronously:

| Phase | What it does | Inner reboot |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Preflight + snapshot: admin, AKS EE installed, single-node topology, install az if missing (signature-verified), `az login --identity`, set shared kubeconfig + pin AKS EE kubectl, detect AIO namespace presence, capture the pre-upgrade snapshot (deployed Kubernetes version, host AKS EE version, node count, Arc state, and AIO namespace presence), validate target version if set, initialize `progress.json`, set `AcceptUpgrade` for the run | No |
| 1 | Stage one hop: check whether the target minor is already met, then stage the next AKS EE update from Microsoft Update (a Windows Update scan, download, and install that self-extracts into the update-cache) and install the cached MSI with `Start-AksEdgeUpdate -Force`. Goes to Phase 2 when staged, Phase 3 to verify and finalize when Microsoft Update offers nothing | No |
| 2 | Apply: `Import-Module AksEdge -Force` then `Start-AksEdgeControlPlaneUpdate -firstControlPlane $true -Force` | Yes (node VM) |
| 3 | Verify hop + decide: deployed Kubernetes version, `/readyz`, nodes Ready, `Test-AksEdgeArcConnection`. Decide: target reached -> Phase 99, patch mode -> Phase 99, max hops exceeded -> fail, else loop back to Phase 1 | No |
| 99 | Finalize: re-pin `AcceptUpgrade $false` (best-effort), write `siteops.aksee.upgrade.state=succeeded` (with `appliedVersion`, `fromVersion`, `runId`), remove the az token cache | No |

The host does not reboot during the upgrade (only the inner node VM does), so
the worker normally runs straight through. The at-startup Scheduled Task trigger
is kept as a safety net for an unrelated host reboot, which the phase state
machine resumes from.

**Idempotent re-run.** Re-applying the manifest resets local state and re-runs
the worker. When no newer patch is available, Phase 1 records a no-op, the
verify gate checks the current platform state, and Phase 99 attempts to tag
`succeeded`. The launcher's pre-run tag reset is best-effort, and the shipped
wait checks only the state tag rather than the run identifier.

## Prerequisites

1. **An AKS EE single-node cluster is already deployed and Arc-connected** on
   the target VM (for example by the `host-bootstrap/aksee` bootstrap).
2. **The Arc machine's system-assigned managed identity can write tags on the
   Arc machine resource.** The worker authenticates as this identity only to write
   the completion tag. The post-upgrade verification runs on-box through AKS EE
   cmdlets (`Test-AksEdgeArcConnection`) and `kubectl`, so it needs no Azure
   permission. There is no service principal fallback. The single permission the
   upgrade needs is `Microsoft.Resources/tags/write` on the Arc machine resource,
   granted by `Tag Contributor` scoped to the machine or its resource group.
   `Contributor` also works. A VM bootstrapped by `host-bootstrap/aksee` already
   holds a broader grant (it Arc-connected the cluster), so no extra assignment is
   needed there.

```bash
ARC_ID=$(az resource show -g <rg> -n <vm-name> --resource-type Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines --query id -o tsv)
PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az resource show --ids "$ARC_ID" --query "identity.principalId" -o tsv)
# Least privilege: Tag Contributor scoped to the Arc machine resource.
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $PRINCIPAL_ID --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal --role "Tag Contributor" --scope "$ARC_ID"
```

3. **The host can reach Microsoft Update with the Microsoft Update opt-in
   enabled.** Each hop is staged from Microsoft Update. The worker starts the
   Windows Update service and scans for the next AKS EE update, so enable
   "receive updates for other Microsoft products" on the host. An air-gapped
   offline staging path is not yet supported.

## Site configuration

The upgrade reuses the same `aksee` parameter section the bootstrap uses:

```yaml
# sites/<site>.yaml
name: my-site
subscription: <subscription-id>
resourceGroup: <rg-name>
location: <region>
parameters:
  aksee:
    machineName: my-arc-windows-vm
    # Optional. Set for minor-mode upgrades to stop at a specific version.
    targetKubernetesVersion: "1.33"
properties:
  deployOptions:
    # Set true to enable sequential minor-version hops. Default is false (patch only).
    allowKubernetesMinorUpgrade: true
```

## Run

```bash
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy manifests/aksee-upgrade.yaml -l name=<site>
```

The deploy blocks on the wait step until the state tag reaches a terminal
value. A green deploy means the worker reported a verified applied upgrade or
a verified no-op. A failed deploy can carry `failed-phase-N` or
`failed-needs-remediation`. The state-only wait is not bound to the current
run identifier. Minor-mode multi-hop runs use a 240-minute wait timeout.

## Monitor

On the VM from an admin PowerShell (the working dir is ACL-locked to
Administrators + SYSTEM):

```powershell
$dir = 'C:\ProgramData\siteops\aksee-upgrade'
Get-Content (Join-Path $dir 'state.json') | ConvertFrom-Json | Format-List
Get-Content (Join-Path $dir 'snapshot.json') | ConvertFrom-Json | Format-List
$log = Get-ChildItem (Join-Path $dir 'worker-*.log') | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1
Get-Content $log.FullName -Tail 40 -Wait
```

The AKS EE cmdlet output is captured per call in `aksee-install-msi-*.log`,
`aksee-apply-update-*.log`, `aksee-set-accept-upgrade-*.log`, and their `.err`
siblings. The Windows Update staging runs inline and is logged in the
`worker-*.log`.

## Verify

The worker already verifies, but to confirm by hand after the deploy:

```powershell
$env:KUBECONFIG = 'C:\ProgramData\siteops\aksee-bootstrap\kubeconfig'
kubectl get nodes -o wide          # node at the new Kubernetes version, Ready
Test-AksEdgeArcConnection
```

Read the applied/from versions from the Arc machine tags:

```bash
az tag list --resource-id "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/<vm-name>" --query "properties.tags" -o json
```

## Trident remediation

If the deploy fails with the tag value `failed-needs-remediation`, the node VM
hit the known Trident/EFI finalize failure and needs a manual step. Console into
the Linux node VM and re-run `trident`:

```powershell
# On the host, find the node VM id and console in
hcsdiag list
hcsdiag console <node-vm-id>
# Inside the VM, re-run the finalize
sudo trident
```

After the node recovers, re-run the manifest. The worker re-checks the version
and health and tags `succeeded` once the cluster is healthy.

## Re-run a failed phase

The launcher resets state on a normal re-deploy, so re-running the manifest is
the supported retry. To re-drive the worker on the VM without re-deploying, set
`state.json` back to the phase to resume from and start the task:

```powershell
$dir = 'C:\ProgramData\siteops\aksee-upgrade'
'{ "phase": 0, "status": "running", "error": null }' | Set-Content (Join-Path $dir 'state.json')
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName SiteOpsAksEeUpgrade
```

## Known limitations

- **Single-node only.** The worker fails preflight on a multi-node cluster.
- **Workloads are down during each apply.** The in-place A/B update stops the
  node VM, updates its OS partition, and restarts it. AIO does not support live
  upgrades and expects downtime.
- **AIO health is not verified.** The worker checks the cluster platform (nodes
  Ready, Arc connected) but not AIO. Confirm AIO after the upgrade.
- **The runCommand returns early.** `executionState=Succeeded` means the
  launcher registered the task, not that the upgrade finished. Gate on the
  `wait` step, never on the runCommand result.
- **State tags are best-effort.** The pre-run reset and terminal writes can
  warn without failing local worker completion. The shipped wait checks state,
  not `runId`, so inspect the host state and worker log if the wait result does
  not match the current operation.
- **Minor upgrades are sequential.** AKS EE cannot skip a minor version. A
  three-hop upgrade (1.31 -> 1.32 -> 1.33) takes three full stage/apply/verify
  cycles, each with an inner node-VM reboot. Plan for extended downtime.
