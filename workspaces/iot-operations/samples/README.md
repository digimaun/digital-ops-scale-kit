# Samples

Deployable examples for Azure IoT Operations. Each sample teaches one
composition or workload pattern.

Samples perform real provider operations. They can create billable resources,
need target-specific permissions, and may assume an existing AIO installation.
Choose a sample from [the workspace table](#samples-in-this-workspace), read
its prerequisites, and prepare one explicit site before running it.

Two shapes are supported, and the line between them is whether other samples can compose the directory.

- **Self-contained workload bundle.** The directory carries a `_partial.yaml` defining its own steps, so other samples can compose it. It may also carry a Bicep template, chaining inputs, and declaration files. Examples: `opc-ua-solution` (with its own template), `secretsync-sample`.
- **Composition.** The directory carries no `_partial.yaml`, so it is an endpoint rather than a building block. Its manifest `include:`s leaf partials from `manifests/` and other samples into one deploy, adds any glue step those partials need such as a `wait` gate, and may attach declaration files supplying what they deploy. Examples: `aio-with-opc-ua`, `aio-with-aksee-bootstrap`, `dataflow-sample` (a declaration over the shared `templates/aio/dataflows/`), `asset-sample` (committed device and asset sets over the shared `templates/aio/assets/`), and the resource-set samples that include the catalog partial and take their declarations from site selections.

Both shapes use the same command progression. Replace `<name>` and `<site>`
after preparing the target described by that sample:

```bash
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations validate samples/<name>/manifest.yaml -l name=<site>
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations plan samples/<name>/manifest.yaml -l name=<site>
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy samples/<name>/manifest.yaml -l name=<site>
```

## Bundle layout (self-contained shape)

```
samples/<name>/
├── manifest.yaml     User entry point. Standalone deployable.
├── README.md         What it deploys, prerequisites, and how to configure it.
├── _partial.yaml     Internal partial. Composed by the manifest above and by other samples.
├── template.bicep    Optional. The sample's own Bicep. Omit it when the steps run shared templates.
├── inputs.yaml       Optional. Step output to step input wiring (consumer fan-in). Attaches at step level.
├── <declaration>.yaml Optional. Operator-authored values. Attaches at manifest level.
└── outputs.yaml      Optional. Sample step outputs forwarded to downstream consumers.
```

Only `manifest.yaml`, `README.md`, and `_partial.yaml` are always present. `secretsync-sample` has no template of its own, since its steps deploy `templates/secretsync/`.

## Composition layout

```
samples/<name>/
├── manifest.yaml     User entry point. include: steps, any glue step they need, plus any declaration it attaches.
├── README.md         What the composition deploys and in what order.
└── <declaration>.yaml Optional. Operator-authored values. Attaches at manifest level.
```

## File conventions

- **`manifest.yaml`** is the user-facing entry point. Composes `_partial.yaml` plus any prerequisite steps the standalone deployment needs (e.g., `_resolve-aio.yaml` reads names from an existing AIO instance).
- **`_partial.yaml`** holds only the steps that ARE the sample. The leading `_` marks it as an internal partial not intended for direct deployment. Composed by `manifest.yaml` and by compositional samples.
- **`template.bicep`** is the sample's deployment template. Pinned to the oldest supported AIO and ADR API versions per `docs/aio-releases.md` (Sample template API-version policy).
- **`inputs.yaml`** wires upstream step outputs into the sample's step parameters. Co-located with the sample (not in the workspace-root `parameters/inputs/` dir). Attaches at step level, since chaining belongs to one consumer.
- **Declaration files** hold operator-authored values such as a `secrets` array or resource definitions. Attach them at manifest level so several steps can read one source. Ordinary values remain overridable through `site.parameters`. Composed resource definitions change through `properties.resourceSets`. Keep declarations separate from `inputs.yaml` even when the same step consumes both. See `docs/parameter-resolution.md` (Choosing an attachment tier).
- **`outputs.yaml`** (optional) is the producer-side fan-out file when the sample's step outputs are consumed elsewhere. Same shape as `parameters/outputs/`.

## Adding a new self-contained sample

1. Create `samples/<name>/`.
2. Add `template.bicep` with your sample's resources. Pin Microsoft.IoTOperations and Microsoft.DeviceRegistry references to the oldest supported API version (the workspace test `test_samples_pin_to_oldest_api_version` enforces this).
3. Add `inputs.yaml` with `{{ steps.X.outputs.Y }}` references for any values the template needs from upstream steps.
4. Add a declaration file for any operator-authored values the sample ships defaults for, and attach it at manifest level in step 6.
5. Add `_partial.yaml` containing the sample steps (no `resolve-aio`, no other prerequisites).
6. Add `manifest.yaml`. For a sample that needs `resolve-aio`, include `_resolve-aio.yaml` from `manifests/` and then include `_partial.yaml`.
7. Optionally add an integration test under `tests/integration/test_<name>_manifest.py`.
8. Optionally compose into `samples/<combo>/manifest.yaml` to demonstrate the sample alongside other deployments. See the next section.

### Scaling beyond a single file

Real samples may exceed the shape above. Conventions:

- **Multiple Bicep files**: `template.bicep` is the entry template called by `_partial.yaml`. Helper templates go under `samples/<name>/modules/`, mirroring `templates/<area>/modules/`.
- **Multiple input files**: prefer one shared `inputs.yaml` for the whole sample. Auto-filtering routes the right keys to each step. If steps need genuinely disjoint inputs, name them `samples/<name>/<step>.yaml` to mirror `parameters/inputs/`.
- **Sample-local outputs**: `outputs.yaml` next to `inputs.yaml`, consumed by other samples via `{{ steps.<sample-step>.outputs.<key> }}`.

## Composing samples

A compositional sample is its own `samples/<name>/` directory with one `manifest.yaml` (and a short README) that pulls in leaf partials. Example:

```yaml
# samples/aio-with-opc-ua/manifest.yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Manifest
name: aio-with-opc-ua
description: AIO platform + OPC UA sample.
selector: "environment=dev"
steps:
  - include: ../../manifests/_aio-fundamentals.yaml
  - include: ../../manifests/_resolve-aio.yaml
  - include: ../../manifests/_secretsync.yaml
    when: "{{ site.properties.deployOptions.enableSecretSync }}"
  - include: ../opc-ua-solution/_partial.yaml
```

Omit `_resolve-aio.yaml` when the composition has no downstream consumer of the resolved instance and custom-location names. The OPC UA sample needs them, so it stays in.

### Composition rules

1. **Compose partials, not standalone manifests.** `manifests/aio-install.yaml` and `samples/<name>/manifest.yaml` are standalone entry points that re-include `_resolve-aio.yaml` so they can be deployed on their own. Composing two of them in one parent will collide on the `resolve-aio` step name. Compose the underlying `_partial.yaml` files instead.
2. **Step names must be unique** across the post-include flat step list. Collision is a parse-time error.
3. **Site selectors and parallel settings** declared on the composing manifest apply at the composition level. The same fields on included partials are silently ignored.

See each sample's own `README.md` for what it deploys, prerequisites, and how to configure before deploying.

`dataflow-sample` and `asset-sample` attach fixed definitions to their own
manifests, which suits a one-off deployment. The resource-set samples use the
fleet route: committed sites compose ordered sets under
`properties.resourceSets`, and each sample includes the same catalog partial
as `manifests/aio-resources.yaml`. See
[resource-catalog.md](../../../docs/resource-catalog.md).
