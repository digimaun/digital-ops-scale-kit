# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions.

## Validation errors

### "Site not found"

```
Error: Site file not found: munich-dev (searched sites/)
```

**Cause**: Site file doesn't exist or has wrong name.

**Solution**: Check `sites/` directory. The site basename, relative path, or internal `name:` must match the identifier referenced in the manifest. See [targeting.md](targeting.md) for the identity model.

### "CLI selector matched no sites"

```
Error: CLI selector `-l environment=prdo` matched no sites.
`environment=prdo` requested. Workspace `environment` values: 'dev', 'prod', 'staging'.
```

**Cause**: A typo in `-l/--selector`, or the requested label value does not exist on any site.

**Solution**: The diagnostic lists the workspace's actual values for each requested key. Fix the typo or update the site labels. See [targeting.md](targeting.md) for the no-match diagnostic and selector grammar.

### "Template file not found"

```
Error: Template not found: templates/missing.bicep
```

**Cause**: Template path is incorrect or file doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Paths are relative to workspace directory. Verify the path exists.

### "Step references unknown step"

```
Error: Step 'aio-instance' references unknown step 'schema-reg' in parameters/p.yaml
```

**Cause**: Output chaining references a step that doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Check step names in manifest match the references in parameter files.

### Site looks wrong after inheritance / overlay

When a site's resolved values disagree with what you expect (wrong location, missing label, an overlay in `sites.local/` or an extras dir not taking effect), preview the fully-resolved shape:

```
siteops -w <workspace> sites <name> --render
```

The output is the post-inherit + post-overlay site as a single YAML doc, with empty `resourceGroup:` omitted for subscription-scoped sites. Use it to verify which file contributed which field before re-running a deploy.

## Deployment errors

### "ResourceGroupNotFound"

**Cause**: Resource group doesn't exist yet.

**Solution**: Either create the resource group first, or use a subscription-scoped step to create it.

### "AuthorizationFailed"

**Cause**: Service principal lacks permissions.

**Solution**: Verify role assignments on the subscription/resource group.

### A `kubectl` step fails with "is forbidden"

**Cause**: The identity has Azure permissions on the cluster resource but no Kubernetes RBAC inside
the cluster. Arc cluster-connect authorizes the connection rather than the operations that travel
over it, so ARM steps succeed while a `kubectl` step is refused by the API server.

**Solution**: Grant the identity named in the error the Kubernetes permissions its step needs, in
the namespace the step writes to. Run the grant from a context that already holds cluster admin,
since the Arc proxy is the connection being refused.

For a development cluster, binding the built-in `admin` role to the target namespace is the quickest
way to continue:

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding siteops-admin --clusterrole=admin --user=<object-id> --namespace=azure-iot-operations
```

Choose the role deliberately before using this beyond a development cluster. `admin` grants read on
Secrets in that namespace, which is where Secret Sync materializes Key Vault values. It also grants
creation of Roles and RoleBindings, which lets a holder widen its own access. Bind a `ClusterRole`
naming the resources your manifests manage instead. A manifest that applies its own Role or
RoleBinding, as the OPC UA sample's simulator does, needs those verbs in the grant. See
[ci-cd-setup.md](ci-cd-setup.md#kubernetes-rbac-for-arc-proxy-operations) for the Azure RBAC
alternative, which keeps the decision in Azure rather than on the cluster.

### Partial deployment failure

**Cause**: One step failed, stopping the site deployment.

**Solution**:

1. Check Azure portal for deployment error details
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run. Bicep deployments are idempotent.

## Arc proxy issues

### "Failed to establish Arc proxy"

**Cause**: Arc cluster unreachable or Cluster Connect not enabled.

**Solution**:

1. Verify cluster is connected: `az connectedk8s show -n <cluster> -g <rg>`
2. Enable Cluster Connect: `az connectedk8s enable-features -n <cluster> -g <rg> --features cluster-connect`

### "Connection refused" during Arc proxy setup

**Cause**: The Arc proxy did not become ready on its allocated local port, or
an external process occupied the slot.

**Solution**: Site Ops allocates separate slots for concurrent proxies and
retries explicit port-in-use failures. If the error persists, stop stale
manual proxy sessions or wait for the process using the port to finish, then
retry.

## Debug commands

```bash
# Prepare and show the executable deployment plan
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations plan manifests/aio-install.yaml

# Emit one publishable JSON plan document
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations plan manifests/aio-install.yaml --output json --projection publishable

# Show the faster compile-free plan shape
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations plan manifests/aio-install.yaml --describe

# Show every value's source file (post inherit + overlay merge)
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations sites <name> --show-sources

# Print the fully-resolved site as YAML
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations sites <name> --render

# Check Azure CLI authentication
az account show
```
