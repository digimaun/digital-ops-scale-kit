# Digital Operations Scale Kit

**Fleet-scale Azure infrastructure deployment.**

> [!NOTE]
> This project is under active development. If you're an Azure IoT Operations customer or interested in fleet-scale deployment, reach out at <aioteam@microsoft.com>.

Deploy Azure IoT Operations, or any Azure infrastructure, across dozens of sites with a single command. Per-site customization, parallel execution, and failure isolation built in.

```bash
# Deploy to all production sites
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy manifests/aio-install/manifest.yaml -l "environment=prod"
```

## Why Scale Kit?

Keep one deployment workflow for your fleet and change only what varies by
site. Scale Kit combines reusable deployment content with Site Ops, the CLI
that runs it across your selected targets.

- **Reuse the same deployment across sites.** Compose templates and ordered
  steps once, then supply each site's subscription, resource group, and settings.
- **Target the right part of your fleet.** Select one site, an environment,
  or a labeled group with the same command.
- **Review before making changes.** Validate configuration and inspect a plan
  before submitting deployments.
- **See what happened at each site.** Run sites concurrently with failure
  isolation, and distinguish completed, failed, and skipped operations.

The same workspace and commands work locally and in CI/CD. Site Ops runs on
demand, with no persistent orchestration service to operate.

## Scale Kit and Site Ops

**Scale Kit** provides the deployment content and examples. Its included
IoT Operations workspace covers AIO installation, upgrades, workload resources,
and host lifecycle operations.

**Site Ops** is the reusable engine. It orchestrates your Bicep, ARM, kubectl,
and wait steps, so you can also use it with infrastructure beyond AIO.

A **site** describes a target and its settings. A **manifest** describes the
steps to run. A **workspace** groups those files with their templates and
parameters. Reusing a manifest across sites keeps deployment logic separate
from environment-specific configuration.

## Quick start

**[Start with AIO on one Site](docs/guided-inputs.md).**

With an approved workspace package, inspect required inputs, supply one
target inline or by file, review a plan, and deploy to an existing
Arc-connected Kubernetes cluster without cloning this repository.
The [local checkout guide](docs/getting-started.md) keeps the configured-Site
route for development or fleet preparation.

Configured Sites remain available for repeated and fleet deployments.

Deployment creates or updates Azure resources and can incur charges.
Once that first site is working, expand the selector to deploy the same
manifest across your fleet.

## Browse deployment choices

Inspect local operations and samples before supplying deployment inputs:

```bash
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations browse
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations browse aio-install
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations browse --tag mqtt
```

Browsing reads descriptions and authored guidance without loading Site values
or invoking deployment tools. Use the same name with `plan` and `deploy`,
or select the explicit path shown on the card. See [browse deployment content](docs/browse-content.md)
for filters, private JSON and the installation-to-workload journey.

Use `browse --source` to inspect a source's published index without cloning.
[Remote browsing](docs/remote-content.md) identifies the exact source revision
and links to its pinned guides. It does not acquire deployable workspace
content or grant deployment permissions.
