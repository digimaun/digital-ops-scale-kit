# Install Site Ops from a release

Install an identified Site Ops build without cloning this repository.
If uv is available, use the release's exact wheel command. Otherwise, use
its generated Windows or Linux bootstrap. Both routes use
stock [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and its normal tool and Python locations.

The wheel route uses your approved dependency feed. The bootstrap
authenticates an archive containing the same engine wheel and its complete
recorded dependencies. Choose the route whose requirements and provenance
guarantees match your environment.

A Site Ops release installs the engine only. Workspace content has its own
source and version. Select a compatible release from an approved source with
`--source SOURCE@RELEASE` in the [guided deployment](guided-inputs.md),
use a [workspace pin](projects.md#run-project-pin) for repeatable fleets,
or use a local checkout. Installing the engine does not acquire or authorize
that content.

A release without these assets uses the
[linked Site Ops release](releasing.md#release-content-against-an-existing-engine)
or the [contributor source installation](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup)
path.

## Choose an installation route

The bootstrap scripts support Windows x64 and x64 Linux distributions based
on glibc, such as Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu 26.04 and Azure Cloud Shell. Install
`curl` and GitHub CLI 2.95 or newer first. The scripts never use
administrator rights or install OS packages. Select an
exact approved release. Its release notes provide complete commands with the
tag, source commit, publisher and script digest already filled in.
Do not use a floating branch or `latest` as installation
authority. Both scripts disclose required tool changes and ask for consent.
To print those changes and stop without downloading anything, add
`--dry-run` on Linux or `-DryRun` on Windows to the script invocation.
Use `--yes` on Linux or `-Yes` on Windows only for an explicitly approved
unattended installation. Use these routes with releases that contain the
bootstrap and compatible workspace assets. Check the selected release's
asset inventory before using these commands. Azure login and
deployment are separate.

| Route | Choose it when | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| [You have uv](#install-the-release-wheel) | uv and a package feed that serves the runtime dependencies are already configured. | uv from an approved channel and a configured package feed. |
| [One command](#bootstrap-from-https) | uv is not installed, or you want the verified installation archive. | Supported shell, `curl` and GitHub CLI 2.95 or newer. No administrator rights. |
| [Checks the script's GitHub attestation before it runs](#verify-the-bootstrap-script) | Your policy requires publisher provenance before any installer code runs. | The same as one command, with GitHub CLI 2.95 or newer in version 2 from an approved channel. No GitHub login. |

Managed environments can [provision approved tools first](#before-you-start),
then use the same verified bootstrap. This keeps one bundle verification
and installation path.

The uv route trusts the approved release channel and dependency feed.
Native uv does not verify the detached proof. The one command route trusts
official HTTPS delivery for the initial script, which is not independently
authenticated before it starts. It is suitable when your policy accepts the
official release endpoint as that authority. Later verification of the
archive does not retroactively authenticate that script. For publisher
provenance before any installer code runs, select the verified path. It
checks the detached proof, exact publisher, source commit, signing workflow,
caller and runner before execution. A checksum obtained alongside a script
from the same location does not add independent publisher authentication.
The script enrolls a source only when you ask it to.

### Bootstrap from HTTPS

Copy the complete Bash or PowerShell command from your approved release's
`Install Site Ops` section. It downloads the script fully, checks the exact
size and SHA-256 from the reviewed release instructions, then runs it from
a fresh private directory. A failed download or mismatch stops execution.
The command removes its temporary script when it finishes.

Run it from a trusted user shell with the normal protected temporary
directory. The generated command installs the engine only. It asks before
tool changes and leaves Azure authentication and source enrollment separate.
The scripts do not run `gh auth login` or `az login`, and they download
public release assets anonymously. The PowerShell command sets its
execution policy only for the child process. An organization policy may
still prohibit unsigned scripts. Use your approved managed installation
path in that case.

Repeating the same selected installation checks the retained bundle before
skipping native tool changes. The script retains the authenticated ZIP and proof
in private user storage for that exact release selection. It rechecks
their proof on repeat without downloading the same assets again. This
uses additional disk space beside the extracted bundle. A different
build or an explicit repair requires
`--replace` on Linux or `-Replace` on Windows. This opts into native
uv replacement or repair in ordinary shared uv tool storage. Review the
selected version, source commit and existing installation before using it. An interrupted
extraction or changed retained bundle fails for inspection rather than
overwriting the existing directory. The bootstrap does not claim a
transactional rollback.

### Install the engine selected by a content release

With a reviewed bootstrap that supports content selection, use
`--content-release` or `-ContentRelease` in place of the direct engine
`--release` or `-Release` input. Supply the content release's tag and full
source commit:

```bash
bash ./siteops-bootstrap.sh --content-release "<content-release-tag>" \
  --source-commit "<content-source-commit>"
```

```powershell
.\siteops-bootstrap.ps1 -ContentRelease "<content-release-tag>" `
  -SourceCommit "<content-source-commit>"
```

Obtain and approve the bootstrap itself through one of the routes above.
Content selection does not authenticate a script you already executed.
The selected content release must publish `siteops-engine.json` and its
detached proof. The bootstrap verifies that reference, displays the selected
engine, then separately checks the exact engine bundle, proof and version
before installation. The referenced engine may belong to an earlier release
in the same source repository.

Direct engine installation remains available with `--release` or `-Release`,
including older combined releases. A missing or rejected content reference
does not fall back to another engine or a source checkout. For a release
without that metadata, use its explicit engine installation instructions.
Do not combine the two release inputs.

Repeat installation rechecks both retained proofs without downloading the
same assets again. Changing engines still requires explicit replacement.
Source enrollment remains a separate choice and applies to the selected
content source, not a policy supplied by the engine reference. Installation
does not acquire workspace content, sign in or authorize Azure deployment.

### Verify the bootstrap script

Your release's notes contain this command with every value filled in.
Expand `Verify the script before it runs` in their `Install Site Ops`
section and copy it from there. The placeholders below explain the checks
and let you build the command without the notes.

Install GitHub CLI 2.95 or newer in version 2 through an approved channel
before any route. Some distribution packages, such as Ubuntu 24.04's, are
older than the qualified verifier. Download the versioned script and its proof without
executing either one. Neither public asset requires GitHub authentication.
The verification below uses the source commit from your reviewed release
instructions, not an identity read from the script or proof.

```bash

  set -euo pipefail

Do not change these publisher, workflow or runner values to accommodate a
failed check. Confirm that the repository is the publisher you intend. The
checks prove that its workflows built the script, not that it is the right
publisher. The command installs the engine only. Enroll a content source
separately, as described in [Use the installed CLI](#use-the-installed-cli).
The release ZIP has its own detached proof and is verified
again by the authenticated script. In a managed environment,
[provision approved tools first](#before-you-start). Preinstalled tools that
already meet the supported versions are retained.

### Azure Cloud Shell and Codespaces

Azure Cloud Shell provides `curl`, GitHub CLI and Azure CLI. The bootstrap
acquires pinned native uv when needed and provisions Python managed by uv,
without requiring a system Python, pipx or virtualenv installation.
On every host it makes no OS package changes and fails with a remedy if
`curl` or GitHub CLI is missing. It reports a missing Azure CLI without
failing, because only later Azure operations need it.

The authenticated application uses only bundled wheels and no package index.
Runtime downloads use uv's verified catalog and system certificates, or an
explicitly configured HTTPS `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`. Keep configuration
and diagnostics private. uv does not read pip configuration. The ordinary
online wheel route separately uses your approved uv package index.
Check whether your Cloud Shell storage persists `$HOME`. An idle
or interrupted session may end a long deployment. Confirm the current Azure
identity and subscription privately before resource reads or deployment.

The Bash bootstrap keeps retained files under
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/siteops` and stages downloads inside
it, so the system temporary directory is not used. The directory must be
private to the current user, and its ancestors must not be untrusted or
symlinked. Ancestors may be writable by your own user private group, as
with the common `0002` login umask, but not by other users or shared groups.
If your XDG data path is shared, select a private location that you own with
trusted ancestors before installing. The script rejects an unsafe root
before choosing a retained uv executable or reading cached assets.
The Windows bootstrap checks the same boundary for its
`LOCALAPPDATA\siteops` directory, including ancestor write access and
reparse points, before using retained tools or downloads. It stages
downloads in `LOCALAPPDATA\siteops\install-staging`, never `%TEMP%`, and
removes each run's directory when it exits. Both scripts use the first
GitHub CLI on `PATH` only when the executable and every parent directory
are owned by you or the system and other users cannot modify, delete or
change permissions on them. Standard Program Files installations and
installations for a single user qualify. Shims in shared locations do not.
Site Ops turns off GitHub CLI telemetry for the commands it runs. It also
checks the complete path and ACL of selected uv tools, ordinary uv storage
and the concrete Python that uv manages before running them. Existing qualified uv
0.12.20 is reused when its executable bytes and path pass admission.
Otherwise the script acquires the native archive pinned by checksum into a
protected Site Ops tooling cache without changing another uv installation.
When no uv is on `PATH`, both scripts also place the pinned uv in your
ordinary command directory for later `uv tool uninstall siteops`. Both
scripts provision Python without command aliases, and the Windows
bootstrap adds no Python registry entries. Explicit
`UV_TOOL_DIR`, `UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR` and `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` are honored
after path admission. The runtime download uses uv's trusted system
certificates or an explicitly configured HTTPS
`UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`. The authenticated application installation
uses only bundled wheels and no package index.
An otherwise private data root does not make an existing writable
child directory or executable safe. On Windows, the fixed
`ROOT_PATH`, `ROOT_ANCESTOR_*` and `ROOT_DATA_*` error categories
distinguish a path, ancestor or data directory rejection. `TOOL_*`
identifies a selected executable or its parent. Neither prints the
directory or account identity. Inspect the affected directory and
its ACL locally. Select private user storage beneath trusted
ancestors rather than relaxing permissions on shared storage.
The Windows bootstrap requires a regular copied `siteops.exe` whose bytes
match the selected environment's executable. It rejects file symlinks,
redirected directories, unrelated commands and changed launcher bytes
before running the command.

The `Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations` Codespace may use Ubuntu 24.04,
but its base image can change. Check `/etc/os-release` and tool versions in
the actual session. The bootstrap preserves another uv installation and
uses a pinned executable when its selected version is not qualified.
Application and Python directories remain ordinary uv storage, including
explicit directory selections that pass admission. Group write access is
accepted only from your own user private group. Directories writable by
other users or shared groups are refused rather than having their
permissions changed automatically. Select protected storage after reviewing
the access needed by other applications.
Sign in to Azure explicitly when needed. Its local k3d cluster is not
connected to Azure Arc until you connect it separately with authorization.
For both hosted journeys, installing the CLI is only the first step: obtain
a workspace from an approved source and review a plan before deploying to
an existing cluster connected to Azure Arc.

The script verifies `siteops` inside its child shell and prints its
`Command directory:` on success. If `siteops` is not on the parent shell's
current PATH, open a new shell or add the printed directory for this session:

```bash
export PATH="<printed command directory>:$PATH"
```

```powershell
$env:PATH = "<printed command directory>;" + $env:PATH
```

The printed directory can differ when a native manager location was
explicitly selected. Do not assume a fixed command directory.

## Before you start

Run as your ordinary user rather than as an administrator or with `sudo`, and
keep downloaded files in a private directory. After consent, the bootstrap
provisions only uv and managed Python. Install `curl` and GitHub CLI first,
through your organization's approved channels when software installation is
centrally managed.

| Prerequisite | Requirement | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| Platform | Windows x64, or x64 Linux based on glibc such as Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu 26.04 or Azure Cloud Shell | Bootstrap |
| Native manager | uv 0.12.20 from an approved channel. The bootstrap acquires a copy pinned by checksum when no qualified uv is on `PATH`. | Release wheel |
| Python | CPython managed by uv. uv provisions 3.11.16 when needed, without a system Python installation. | Both routes, with no separate installation |
| Package feed | An approved index that serves the required runtime wheels. Configure it in uv. | Online release wheel |
| GitHub CLI | Version 2.95.0 or newer in the 2.x release line | Bootstrap, and Site Ops verification of published workspace content. No login. |

Obtain these tools through your organization's managed software channel or their
official instructions:
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
[managed Python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/), and
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).
The bootstrap preserves another uv installation and uses an admitted qualified
executable or a pinned tooling copy. The application and runtime remain in
normal uv storage. It does not borrow Azure CLI's interpreter or change global
Python aliases.

Installing the CLI does not authenticate to Azure or deploy resources. Review
workspace content separately, then select it with `--source SOURCE@RELEASE`,
an operator project or `-w`. Azure CLI, Bicep and kubectl requirements depend
on the operations you select, as described in
[Azure CLI and az login](#azure-cli-and-az-login).

### Azure CLI and az login

Site Ops currently makes every Azure call through Azure CLI (`az`), using the
account you signed in with `az login`. `siteops plan` and `siteops deploy`
check the tools the selected steps need and name any missing tool with its
fix. `siteops validate` and `siteops browse` need no Azure tools.

| What the selected steps do | What you need |
|---|---|
| Deployment steps, wait steps, and resource reads such as `inputs --read-resources` or resource ID answers to `plan` and `deploy` | [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/installazurecli) 2.70.0 or newer. Bicep templates in local content compile with `az bicep build`. |
| `kubectl` steps on a cluster connected through Azure Arc | Azure CLI with the connectedk8s extension (`az extension add --name connectedk8s`), and kubectl. The cluster needs cluster connect enabled, and the account needs [Kubernetes permissions](ci-cd-setup.md#kubernetes-rbac-for-arc-proxy-operations). On first use, `az connectedk8s proxy` downloads its proxy binary. |

Any `az login` mode works: an interactive user, device code, a service
principal with a secret or certificate, a managed identity, or federated
credentials in CI as shown in [CI/CD setup](ci-cd-setup.md). Each Site's
subscription must be visible to that account. Run `az account list` to check
before deploying. Run `az upgrade` when `siteops plan` reports an older
Azure CLI. The connectedk8s and azure-iot-ops extensions require the same
minimum version.

## Install the release wheel

This is the ordinary path. It trusts the release channel you download from and
the package feed your environment is configured to use.

With uv available, use the exact release wheel on either platform. uv owns the
managed Python runtime and ordinary tool locations. Set an approved
`UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` for dependency downloads if your organization requires a
private feed. uv does not read pip's index configuration.

```powershell
uv tool install "https://github.com/Azure/digital-ops-scale-kit/releases/download/<tag>/siteops-<version>-py3-none-any.whl" `
  --python 3.11.16 --managed-python --no-build --system-certs
```

```bash
uv tool install "https://github.com/Azure/digital-ops-scale-kit/releases/download/<tag>/siteops-<version>-py3-none-any.whl" \
  --python 3.11.16 --managed-python --no-build --system-certs
```

Use the exact command printed in the release notes to avoid assembling the
tag and wheel filename yourself. `--no-build` requires built wheels rather
than executing downloaded source builds.

Runtime dependencies come from the package index your environment is already
configured to use. To name that index in the command instead, add
`--default-index <your approved index>`. An unreachable index fails the
installation. Use your own approved configuration rather than another
organization's index URL.

Native uv does not verify the publisher's detached attestation. Use the
verified bundle path when you require independent publisher authentication
and the producer's complete recorded dependency set. The standalone wheel's
proof remains available for independent inspection. The verified bootstrap
instead authenticates the ZIP containing that same wheel.

Replacing or repairing an online installation uses the same exact wheel
command with `--reinstall`. Confirm the result with `siteops --version`.
Review the [installation transitions](#select-another-build-repair-or-remove)
before switching between online and verified routes.

## Install the verified bundle

Use either bootstrap route above. Both authenticate `siteops-install.zip`
against its detached proof before extracting the installer helper. For
provenance before the first script runs, choose
[Verify the bootstrap script](#verify-the-bootstrap-script).
An environment with centrally provisioned tools uses that same route.

### Release assets

| Asset | Contents | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `siteops-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` | The Site Ops engine wheel | Ordinary installation from a release you already trust |
| `siteops-install.zip` | That identical wheel, pinned runtime dependency wheels, `pylock.toml`, `siteops-install.py`, the bundle inventory and license notices | Verified installation with a recorded dependency set and no package index |

Each asset has its own detached proof, `<asset>.attestation.jsonl`.
Releases with `siteops-bootstrap.sh` and `siteops-bootstrap.ps1` also provide
a proof for each script. Both bootstrap routes run the same platform
script and consume the authenticated archive.

Use the script and engine ZIP from the same release. The script verifies
archive provenance before extracting the helper to fresh protected storage.
The helper cannot select the publisher or authorize its own archive.

The ZIP contains the engine wheel, all recorded runtime dependency wheels,
`pylock.toml` and the shared installer helper. The helper checks the complete
payload before calling native uv with its `--offline`, `--no-index` and
`--no-build` options,
then checks the installed application bytes and runtime binding. A raw
`uv tool install --with-requirements pylock.toml` command is not a substitute
for those checks. Keep the producer's lock unchanged.

The bootstrap retains protected release files for repeat or repair requests.
It runs a fresh helper from the authenticated archive, not an unchecked
retained copy. You do not separately download the standalone wheel or its
proof for this route.

### Publisher and managed environment policy

The expected repository, source ref, source commit, signing workflow, caller
and runner class come from your approved release selection. Downloaded
metadata cannot choose them. The official scripts require the exact
`_siteops-distribution.yaml` signer and `release.yaml` caller at the selected
commit, with `self-hosted` provenance. This class does not identify a
particular runner pool. An explicitly selected CI preview uses its own
repository, source ref, commit and `ci.yaml` caller. It does not qualify as
an official release.

GitHub CLI verifies the signing chain and file digest. The bootstrap also
checks the source, signer, caller and runner fields before extraction.
`--bundle` reads the detached proof without a GitHub login. Refreshing the
trusted root can still use the network. Verification establishes origin and
integrity, not the absence of defects.

Application installation uses only admitted bundle wheels, but the bootstrap
is not a fully offline installer. Runtime or tool acquisition, release
downloads and trusted root refresh can require network access. A managed
environment must approve those channels and storage locations before use.
If its policy cannot permit them, stop and use an independently approved
managed distribution rather than bypassing verification.

## Use the installed CLI

```text
siteops --version
siteops --help
```

The package and command report the exact artifact version. Versioned releases
use their declared source package version, and identified builds add a suffix,
for example `1.0.0b1+build.12345.1.gabcdef123456`. The engine version and Scale
Kit content version remain separate identities.

If the command is not found, use `uv tool update-shell` to add uv's command
directory to `PATH`, then open a new terminal. A successful installation
message is not proof that `PATH` resolves to that command: check
`siteops --version` after any installation change.

Before using published content, enroll its source once. Run the same
command again to renew the 30 day enrollment:

```text
siteops source enroll official
```

[Approved sources](projects.md#use-an-approved-source) covers other
publishers and custom policies. Then continue with the
[direct guided deployment](guided-inputs.md), or use
`siteops -w <workspace>` with local content. The same
[Site configuration](site-configuration.md) and
[manifest model](manifest-reference.md) support retained projects and fleets.

## Select another build, repair, or remove

Select the intended release and its complete command before changing the
installation. Neither route follows `latest` automatically.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Confirm a verified installation | Rerun the same release's bootstrap command. |
| Upgrade, downgrade or repair a verified installation | Add `--replace` to the final Bash script invocation or `-Replace` to the PowerShell invocation. |
| Upgrade, downgrade or repair an online installation | Rerun the exact wheel command with `--reinstall`. |
| Move an online uv installation to a verified one | Use the selected bootstrap with `--replace` or `-Replace`. |
| Move a verified installation to an online one | Review the different dependency and provenance guarantees, then use the exact wheel command with `--reinstall`. |
| Remove Site Ops | `uv tool uninstall siteops` |
| Renew the content source enrollment | `siteops source enroll official`, using the name you enrolled. Rerunning the bootstrap with `--enroll-source` or `-EnrollSource` also renews it. |

The bootstrap leaves a matching, validated installation unchanged.
Replacement uses native uv and the selected admitted runtime. It does not
edit uv's environment or metadata by hand. Keep tool maintenance and Python
runtime maintenance separate from application replacement.
A missing or inconsistent runtime binding requires inspection and native
`uv tool uninstall siteops` before a fresh installation. `--replace` and
`-Replace` repair the selected application, not an invalid runtime binding.

Installation behavior:

- A changed or truncated bundle payload is refused before native installation.
- An unrelated exposed command is preserved. Remove it with its owning manager
  only after inspection, then rerun the selected installation.
- If an older pipx installation owns `siteops`, use `pipx uninstall siteops`
  after inspection, then install the approved release with uv. Do not remove
  unrelated pipx tools or shared uv storage.
- Unknown Python startup files stop a verified replacement. Inspect the tool
  before using `uv tool uninstall siteops`, then reinstall from the approved
  release. Installation does not silently remove those files.
- Native `uv tool upgrade` and an online reinstall do not perform the
  bootstrap's publisher and payload checks. Use the verified bootstrap route
  for verified maintenance.
- Confirm `siteops --version` and command ownership after a reported failure.
- Interruption is not a transaction. Forced process termination, power loss, or
  storage failure is not a guaranteed rollback.

## Retained files and private diagnostics

| Platform | Bootstrap data root |

Keep retained bundles and their recorded wheel/lock paths intact. The bootstrap
rechecks retained state. Inspect a mismatch rather than overwriting the
directory. Rerun the approved bootstrap selection to acquire missing assets.

uv owns application environments, Python installations and command exposure.
The bootstrap honors admitted `UV_TOOL_DIR`, `UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR` and
`UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` locations. These may be shared with other uv tools.
Uninstalling Site Ops does not authorize deleting shared uv storage, runtimes,
tooling or approved sources. Diagnostics can contain local paths and
environment detail. Keep them private and review them before sharing.

## Common problems

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Attestation verification fails | Stop before extracting or installing. Confirm the selected release, source commit, both files, and a trusted GitHub CLI installation. |
| GitHub CLI 2.95 or newer is required | Install GitHub CLI from https://cli.github.com or your approved channel, then retry. Some distribution packages are older than the qualified version. |
| The GitHub CLI executable must be protected from other users | Use a GitHub CLI installed in a location that only you or administrators can change, earlier in `PATH` than any shared shim. |
| No matching distribution during a release wheel installation | The configured feed does not serve a required runtime wheel for this interpreter. Use the verified bundle, which carries them. |
| `uv` is not found | Use the bootstrap, or provision the qualified uv through an approved channel. |
| The installed build is not the one you selected | Use the intended release's bootstrap with `--replace` or `-Replace`, then check command ownership and version. |
| `siteops` runs an unexpected program | Another command with that name is earlier in `PATH`. Resolve the ownership of that command before retrying. |
| The Windows bootstrap refuses a retained uv executable or Python directory | Inspect the selected path, ACL and pinned bytes before retrying. It preserves another uv installation and will not overwrite an unrelated command. |
| The tool has unrecognized Python startup files | Inspect the environment before using native uninstall. Rerun the approved bootstrap after removing the tool with its manager. |
| A retained bundle fails validation | Preserve it for private inspection. Acquire the selected release again in an approved private location rather than editing the lock or wheels. |

## Supported platforms

Each Site Ops release qualifies both installation paths on Windows and Linux
across CPython 3.10 through 3.14 before publication. PyPy, Python builds with
free threading, Linux distributions based on musl, macOS, and ARM are outside
the supported matrix.
