"""Integration tests for the dataflow-sample manifest.

The sample declares dataflow resources in YAML and deploys them through the
shared catalog templates, so this suite is the live qualification for those
templates. Compiling proves the Bicep is well formed. Only a deploy proves the
declaration reaches the resource provider in a shape it accepts and that the
resources project to the cluster.

Cluster-side assertions are the live source of truth. A dataflow whose
`endpointRef` names an endpoint that does not exist is accepted by ARM, reports
success, and never moves data. The CR checks below are what catch that.
