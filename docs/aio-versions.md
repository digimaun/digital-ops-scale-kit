# AIO Versions

Azure IoT Operations (AIO) ships on a release cadence; each release pins specific versions of the AIO extension, cert-manager, secret store, and a matching control-plane API version. The scalekit represents every supported release as a version config file under `workspaces/iot-operations/parameters/aio-versions/` and selects one per site via `site.properties.aioRelease`.

## How release selection works

```
site.properties.aioRelease: "2603"
            │
            ▼
workspaces/iot-operations/parameters/aio-versions/2603.yaml
            │
            ▼  (siteops auto-forwards matching params to Bicep)
templates/aio/enablement.bicep       ──► cert-manager, secret store extensions
templates/aio/instance.bicep         ──► AIO extension + instance (dispatches on aioApiVersion)
templates/secretsync/enable-secretsync.bicep  ──► instance update (dispatches on aioApiVersion)
templates/deps/adr-ns.bicep          ──► ADR namespace (dispatches on adrApiVersion)
```

Each version YAML is a flat schema:

```yaml
# parameters/aio-versions/2603.yaml
aioVersion: "1.3.38"            # AIO extension version pinned in Arc
aioTrain: stable                # Extension release train
aioApiVersion: "2026-03-01"     # Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances API version
adrApiVersion: "2026-04-01"     # Microsoft.DeviceRegistry/namespaces API version
certManagerVersion: "0.10.2"
certManagerTrain: stable
secretStoreVersion: "1.3.0"
secretStoreTrain: stable
```

The `aioApiVersion` and `adrApiVersion` values route CREATE and UPDATE operations through their matching versioned modules (for example `templates/aio/modules/instance-2026-03-01.bicep` and `templates/deps/modules/adr-ns-2026-04-01.bicep`). Bicep cannot parameterize API version strings, so the dispatchers use `@allowed` + conditional modules; see [Adding a new AIO version](#adding-a-new-aio-version) below.

## Pinning a site to a release

Set `properties.aioRelease` on the site (or on a parent via inheritance). The value must be the stem of a YAML under `parameters/aio-versions/`.

```yaml
# sites/munich-prod.yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Site
name: munich-prod
inherits: base-site.yaml

properties:
  aioRelease: "2603"    # must match parameters/aio-versions/2603.yaml
```

If not specified, the site inherits whatever `base-site.yaml` declares (`"2603"` today).

## Available versions

Every file in `workspaces/iot-operations/parameters/aio-versions/` is a shipped version. At time of writing:

| Stem | `aioApiVersion` | `adrApiVersion` | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| `2512` | `2025-10-01` | `2025-10-01` | |
| `2602` | `2025-10-01` | `2025-10-01` | |
| `2603` | `2026-03-01` | `2026-04-01` | base-site default |

Source of truth for every pinned version number is the YAML itself. Cross-reference against the [IoT Operations version matrix](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-ops-cli-extension/wiki/IoT-Operations-versions) before shipping a new one.

## Upgrading an existing site

Use `aio-upgrade.yaml` to move a site to a newer `aioRelease`. It bumps the Arc extension versions for AIO, secret-store, and (when the cluster's trust source is `SelfSigned`) cert-manager, preserving each extension's existing `configurationSettings`, `releaseTrain`, and identity.

The IoT Operations instance ARM resource has no writable version property and is not mutated by this manifest; new instance child resource types introduced by future AIO releases (broker properties, dataflow profile schema changes, etc.) are out of scope and will need a future tier of upgrade manifests.

```
# 1. Bump aioRelease on the site (or its parent) to the new YAML stem.
# 2. Deploy the upgrade manifest:
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy manifests/aio-upgrade.yaml -l "name=<site>"
```

`aio-install.yaml` remains the greenfield-install manifest. Running it against an already-deployed site is desired-state and can overwrite operator-applied changes on the AIO instance and its children; use `aio-upgrade.yaml` for in-place version moves.

### Supported upgrade paths

In-place upgrades are exercised in CI between adjacent shipped releases (e.g. `2602` -> `2603`). Multi-hop upgrades (e.g. `2512` -> `2603`) are not gated by CI. Perform the hops sequentially through each adjacent release and verify between hops.

Downgrades are not supported by IoT Operations.

### Sample template API-version policy

Sample templates under `templates/solutions/` (e.g. `opc-ua-solution.bicep`) pin every `Microsoft.IoTOperations/*` and `Microsoft.DeviceRegistry/*` reference to the **oldest supported** API version in the matrix above. They rely on RP backward-compatibility so a single file works against every shipped release. Bump these pins only when the oldest supported API version is removed from the matrix, not on every release. The workspace test `test_solutions_pin_to_oldest_api_version` enforces this.

This policy applies only to samples. Fundamentals (`templates/aio/`, `templates/deps/`) use the per-version dispatch described under "Adding a new AIO version".

## Adding a new AIO version

1. **Ship the version YAML.** Create `parameters/aio-versions/<stem>.yaml` with all eight fields (`aioVersion`, `aioTrain`, `aioApiVersion`, `adrApiVersion`, `certManagerVersion`, `certManagerTrain`, `secretStoreVersion`, `secretStoreTrain`).
2. **If `aioApiVersion` is new**, extend the dispatch in both Bicep routers:
   - `templates/aio/instance.bicep`: add to `@allowed` on `param aioApiVersion`, add a new conditional `module instance_<YYYY>` block, push the previously-newest version from `else` into an explicit equality, make the new version the `else`.
   - `templates/aio/modules/update-instance.bicep`: same pattern; the file header has a checklist.
   - Add `templates/aio/modules/instance-<YYYY-MM-DD>.bicep` and `update-instance-<YYYY-MM-DD>.bicep`. Start by copying the previous API version's modules verbatim and change only the API version strings; diverge per-module only when the schema actually changes.
3. **If `adrApiVersion` is new**, extend the ADR dispatch:
   - `templates/deps/adr-ns.bicep`: add to `@allowed` on `param adrApiVersion`, add a new conditional `module ns_<YYYY>` block, fold the previously-newest version into an explicit equality.
   - Add `templates/deps/modules/adr-ns-<YYYY-MM-DD>.bicep` by copying the previous version verbatim and changing the API version string.
4. **If neither API version is new**, no Bicep changes are needed. Siteops forwards the new extension versions via parameter auto-filtering.
5. **Run the workspace suite**: `pytest tests/workspace/ -q`. The relevant checks are:
   - `test_version_config_api_versions_are_allowed_in_bicep`: every `aioApiVersion` must appear in both AIO dispatchers' `@allowed` lists.
   - `test_version_config_adr_api_versions_are_allowed_in_bicep`: every `adrApiVersion` must appear in the ADR dispatcher's `@allowed` list.
   - `test_all_sites_aio_releases_have_config_files`: no site references a missing YAML stem.
   - `TestUpdateInstanceDispatch`: every param of the update-instance router is forwarded by every caller.
6. **Test live**: dispatch the E2E workflow including the new release in `aio-releases`:
   ```
   gh workflow run e2e-test.yaml -f aio-releases=<existing>,<new>
   ```
   The matrix runs each release in its own fresh RG + Arc cluster, and `test_aio_extension_version_matches_version_config` cross-checks the deployed `aioExtension.version` against the YAML.

## Validation summary

Four layers catch version misconfigurations before they reach production:

| Layer | Check | When it runs |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Workflow prep job | Every requested `aio-releases` entry has a matching YAML | E2E dispatch (`e2e-test.yaml`) |
| Workspace unit tests | `@allowed` membership, all-sites coverage, base-site coverage | Every CI run |
| Workspace unit tests | `TestUpdateInstanceDispatch`: caller-vs-router param parity | Every CI run |
| Live integration | Deployed `aioExtension.version` equals YAML's `aioVersion` | E2E matrix (per cell) |
