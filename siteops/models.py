"""Core data models for Azure Site Ops.

This module defines the core resource types:
- Site: A deployment target (subscription, resource group, location)
- Manifest: Orchestrates deployment steps across sites
- DeploymentStep: A single Bicep/ARM template deployment
- KubectlStep: A kubectl operation against an Arc-connected cluster

Resources support K8s-style apiVersion/kind validation:
- apiVersion defaults to 'siteops/v1' if not specified
- kind is validated if present, but optional
