"""Fixtures for integration tests.

Integration tests deploy real manifests against Azure and assert outputs.
The test framework is site-agnostic: it deploys to whatever sites match
the manifest's selector (or a user-provided override), just like production.

Configuration is provided via:
  - Local: sites.local/ overlay files (hand-written YAML, one per site)
  - CI integration suite: SITE_OVERRIDES env var (JSON → auto-generates sites.local/ overlays)
  - E2E suite: SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS env var (os.pathsep-joined dirs
    containing rendered site files, orthogonal to sites.local/)

Behavior when no site config is present:
  - Tests are skipped at collection time (`has_config` check).
Behavior when site config is present but the selector resolves to zero sites:
  - Tests ERROR at fixture time with a diagnostic message. A zero-site
    deployment is never a legitimate integration-test outcome. Silent
    vacuous passes would mask real misconfigurations (wrong selector,
    broken inherits chain, mismatched labels) that were discovered
    previously in exactly this way.

Cluster-side reads (direct kubectl) require a kubeconfig that routes to
the cluster the AIO instance was deployed onto:
  - Local: standard kubectl discovery (~/.kube/config or KUBECONFIG)
  - E2E suite: SITEOPS_TEST_KUBECONFIG env var. Point it at the k3s
    admin file (mode 0644 from create-k3s-cluster). The helpers in
    tests/integration/helpers/kube.py pass `--kubeconfig=<path>` on
    every direct kubectl invocation, independently of the isolated
    per-proxy kubeconfigs used by Site Ops deployment steps.
