"""Structural contract for API-version dispatchers.

An AIO release that introduces a new ARM API generation adds a module per
version and a routing branch in each dispatcher. The routing convention is that
the newest generation is the fallback arm of the selection expression and every
older generation is an explicit equality check.

That convention is otherwise stated only in template comments, and a
misrouted branch still compiles, so it is asserted here. Dispatchers are
discovered rather than listed, so a new one is covered on arrival.
