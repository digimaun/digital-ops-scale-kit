"""Integration tests for the config-driven catalog entry point.

`manifests/aio-resources.yaml` is the fleet route: a site composes ordered sets
through `properties.resourceSets.<area>`, the catalog resolves each set to a
definition file under `parameters/<area>/`, and the deployment gate opens.

`test_dataflow_sample_manifest.py` already qualifies the dataflow templates
through a manifest-attached declaration, so the assertions here are about the
selection mechanism instead: that each gate opened, that the sets the site named
are what deployed, and that per-site values in the declarations resolved to this
site rather than shipping as literal placeholder text.

Every resource area is selected in one deploy. Devices and assets share one
internally ordered step, followed by the independently gated dataflow step.
