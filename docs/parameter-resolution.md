# Parameter Resolution

Parameters flow from multiple sources and are automatically filtered per template.

## Merge order

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 (lowest) | Manifest parameters | `manifest.parameters` list - shared defaults |
| 2 | Site parameters | `site.parameters` section - site-specific overrides |
| 3 (highest) | Step parameters | `step.parameters` list - step-specific overrides |

Later values override earlier values. Nested objects merge recursively. Lists are replaced rather than merged. This order follows the principle of specificity: manifest provides shared defaults, sites override with specific values.

## Choosing an attachment tier

A parameter file's tier follows from what the file holds, not from which step consumes it.

| The file holds | Attach at | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Chaining**: `{{ steps.X.outputs.Y }}` wiring | Step level | Wiring belongs to one consumer and must not be overridable. Step level is the highest-precedence tier. |
| **Declaration**: operator-authored values | Manifest level | Sits below site parameters, so a site or a `sites.local/` overlay overrides ordinary values. Applies to every step, so several steps can read one source. Composed resource collections are the exception below. |

The quick test is whether the file contains `{{ steps.`. If it does, it is a chaining file.

Attaching a declaration at step level makes it unoverridable, because step level outranks site level and lists are replaced wholesale. Keep the two kinds in separate files even when the same step consumes both. The workspace test `test_manifest_level_parameters_carry_no_step_output_refs` enforces the chaining half of the rule.

Manifest-level attachment is safe to use broadly because parameters are filtered per template: a step receives only the keys its own template declares. A `@secure()` value therefore reaches only the template that declares it.

Resource collections governed by a `ParameterComposition` contract are the
exception to ordinary tier precedence. They compose only from manifest-level
sources. Change them by selecting resource sets under `site.properties`, not by
writing the collection array in `site.parameters` or a step parameter file.

When a manifest pulls in others via `include:` (see [manifest-includes.md](manifest-includes.md)), each included manifest's manifest-level `parameters:` are appended after the parent's. Duplicate strings compare by normalized path. Source objects compare by normalized `path` and `forEach`, and their `collections` metadata must agree. The first occurrence keeps its position. That is not the same as the parent winning on a parameter key: different files still load in order, so the later file's scalar or ungoverned list value survives.

## Template variables

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `{{ site.name }}` | `munich-dev` |
| `{{ site.location }}` | `germanywestcentral` |
| `{{ site.resourceGroup }}` | `rg-iot-munich-dev` |
| `{{ site.subscription }}` | `00000000-...` |
| `{{ site.labels.X }}` | Any label value |
| `{{ site.parameters.X.Y }}` | Nested parameter value |
| `{{ site.properties.X.Y }}` | Nested property |
| `{{ site.properties.X[0] }}` | Array indexing |
| `{{ steps.X.outputs.Y }}` | Output from step X |

### Dynamic parameter paths

A parameter file path containing a site template is site-selected:

```yaml
parameters:
  - "parameters/aio-releases/{{ site.properties.aioRelease }}.yaml"
```

After substitution, the path must be relative to the workspace, contain no `..` path segments, and
resolve to a file inside the workspace. A fixed path without a template may still be absolute when
a trusted runtime supplies the file.

## Output chaining

Reference outputs from previous steps:

```yaml
# parameters/inputs/aio-instance.yaml
schemaRegistryId: "{{ steps.schema-registry.outputs.schemaRegistry.id }}"
clExtensionIds: "{{ steps.aio-enablement.outputs.clExtensionIds }}"
```

> **Note**: Prior-step outputs exist only during deployment. `siteops plan`
> records them as typed deferred references rather than resolving them to
> values.

## `parameters/` layout

The directory groups files by the role they play in the parameter merge:

| Subdir | Role | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `parameters/common/` | Site-derived shared values applied to all steps | `common.yaml` |
| `parameters/inputs/` | Consumer fan-in (a step pulls outputs from upstream producers) | `inputs/aio-instance.yaml` pulls from `schema-registry`, `adr-ns`, `aio-enablement` |
| `parameters/outputs/` | Producer fan-out (a single step's outputs feed multiple downstream consumers) | `outputs/aio-instance.yaml` feeds `schema-registry-role` |
| `parameters/aio-releases/` | Per-release version pin files (selected via `site.properties.aioRelease`) | `aio-releases/2607.yaml` |
| `parameters/devices/` | Device definition sets selected through `site.properties.resourceSets.devices` | `devices/site-devices.yaml` |
| `parameters/assets/` | Asset definition sets selected through `site.properties.resourceSets.assets` | `assets/site-assets.yaml` |
| `parameters/dataflows/` | Dataflow definition sets selected through `site.properties.resourceSets.dataflows` | `dataflows/site-telemetry.yaml` |

A step that has both fan-in inputs and fan-out outputs gets two files: one under `inputs/`, one under `outputs/`, named after the step (e.g. `inputs/aio-instance.yaml` and `outputs/aio-instance.yaml`).

A file may instead be named for a class of steps when they all read the same upstream values. `inputs/catalog.yaml` is the fan-in every resource catalog family step reads, so one file serves each family a workspace adds. See [resource-catalog.md](resource-catalog.md).

When one chaining file would be shared by multiple consumer steps **within the same manifest**, prefer one file per consumer step named `<manifest>-<step>.yaml` (e.g. `inputs/aio-upgrade-resolve-extensions.yaml`, `inputs/aio-upgrade-update-extensions.yaml`, and `inputs/aio-upgrade-deploy-release-resources.yaml`). A single shared file ends up with `{{ steps.X.outputs.Y }}` references that look forward from the perspective of the earliest consumer, which structural validation correctly rejects.

Samples co-locate their input and output files inside `samples/<name>/` rather than `parameters/`. The roles are the same. Only the location differs.

## Cross-scope output chaining

RG-level sites can reference outputs from subscription-scoped steps. Subscription outputs are keyed by subscription ID and resolved automatically. A consumer names the producing step the same way it would name an RG-scoped one:

```yaml
# An input file for a step that consumes the subscription-scoped producer
edgeSiteId: "{{ steps.global-edge-site.outputs.site.id }}"
```

`global-edge-site` is a subscription-scoped step in `manifests/_aio-fundamentals.yaml`, deployed once per subscription. `munich-dev` and `munich-prod` are RG-level sites in that same subscription, so both resolve this reference from the one set of outputs that step produced.

The consuming template has to declare the parameter. Auto-filtering removes a
chained value whose name the template does not accept. Executable preparation
also reports any required template parameter that remains absent.

**Resolution priority:**

1. Per-site step outputs (from RG-scoped steps)
2. Subscription outputs (from subscription-scoped steps, matched by site's subscription)

## Auto-filtering

Parameters are automatically filtered to include only values accepted by each
template. Executable preparation then requires every non-nullable parameter
that has no default. Nullable parameters and parameters with explicit defaults
may be omitted. A top-level name derived from a prior operation stays deferred
until the output resolves, when the same schema check runs again. This enables
shared parameter files without postponing known missing inputs:

```yaml
# parameters/common/common.yaml - works with ANY template
location: "{{ site.location }}"
customLocationName: "{{ site.name }}-cl"
aioInstanceName: "{{ site.name }}-aio"
schemaRegistryName: "{{ site.name }}-sr"
adrNamespaceName: "{{ site.name }}-ns"
tags:
  environment: "{{ site.labels.environment }}"
```

When deploying:

- **schema-registry template**: Receives `location`, `tags`, `schemaRegistryName`
- **aio-instance template**: Receives `customLocationName`, `aioInstanceName`
- Extra parameters are omitted

## Best practices

| Parameter type | Where to define |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Site-specific sizing (replicas, memory) | `site.parameters` |
| Derived from site variables | `parameters/common/common.yaml` |
| Output chaining (fan-in) | `parameters/inputs/<step>.yaml` |
| Output chaining (fan-out) | `parameters/outputs/<step>.yaml` |
