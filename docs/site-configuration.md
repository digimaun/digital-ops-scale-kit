# Site Configuration

Sites define **where** to deploy: the Azure subscription, resource group, location, and site-specific configuration.

## Quick decision table

| I want to... | Do this |
|---|---|
| Add a new deployable site | Drop `my-site.yaml` under `workspace/sites/` (any subdir) or an extras dir |
| Share a reusable template across sites | Put it in `workspace/sites/<name>.yaml` (same dir) or `workspace/sites/shared/<name>.yaml` (subdir) and reference via `inherits:` |
| Override a committed site at runtime without a PR | Put `my-site.yaml` in `workspace/sites.local/` (overlay merges, `inherits:` stripped) |
| Inject a site from CI without touching the workspace | Register a dir via `SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS` / `--extra-sites-dir` and drop `my-site.yaml` in it |
| Target one specific site at the CLI | `siteops deploy <manifest> -l name=<site-name>` |
| Target multiple specific sites at the CLI | `siteops deploy <manifest> -l name=<a>,name=<b>` |
| Pin the manifest to a labeled cohort | Set `selector:` in the manifest |
| Hard-code the target list for a manifest | Set `sites:` in the manifest |
| Preview a fully-resolved site (post inherit + overlay) | `siteops -w <workspace> sites <name> --render` |
| See where every value in a resolved site came from | `siteops -w <workspace> sites <name> --show-sources` |

The reference material below covers the model in depth. See [targeting.md](targeting.md) for the selector grammar and the no-match diagnostic.

## Site levels

Sites operate at two levels based on whether they have a `resourceGroup`:

| Site has | Site level | Deploys |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `subscription` + `resourceGroup` | RG-level | Resource-group steps and target-scoped kubectl or wait steps |
| `subscription` only | Subscription-level | `scope: subscription` steps and target-scoped kubectl or wait steps |

RG-level sites are the common case. A subscription-level site deploys shared
resources once for its subscription, such as Azure Edge Sites. RG-level sites
in that subscription can consume those outputs through cross-scope chaining.

## Site structure

**RG-level site** (most common):

```yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Site
name: munich-dev

subscription: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
resourceGroup: rg-iot-munich-dev
location: germanywestcentral

labels:
  environment: dev
  country: DE
  city: Munich

parameters:
  clusterName: munich-dev-arc
  brokerConfig:
    memoryProfile: Low

properties:
  deployOptions:
    enableSecretSync: true
```

### Site identity

A site is reachable by its filename basename, its relative path under the trusted directory, or its internal `name:` field. The three forms are symmetric. By convention `name:` matches the basename, but it can differ when a friendlier identifier is needed. See [targeting.md](targeting.md) for the full identity model and the workspace invariants the orchestrator enforces at load time.

**Subscription-level site** (for shared resources):

```yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Site
name: germany-subscription

subscription: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
location: germanywestcentral
# No resourceGroup → subscription-level site

labels:
  environment: dev
  scope: subscription      # Workspace convention for selectors

parameters:
  edgeSiteName: germany-edge-site
```

## Labels vs Parameters vs Properties

Sites have three ways to attach data, each serving a different purpose:

| Field | Data Type | Filtering | Conditionals | Template Access |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| `labels` | Flat strings only | ✅ `-l "key=value"` | ✅ `when:` | `{{ site.labels.X }}` |
| `parameters` | Any structure | ❌ | ❌ | `{{ site.parameters.X }}` |
| `properties` | Any structure | ❌ | ✅ `when:` | `{{ site.properties.X.Y }}` |

### Labels

Simple strings for **filtering** and **conditionals**:

```yaml
labels:
  environment: prod        # Filter: siteops deploy -l "environment=prod"
  city: Seattle            # Template variable: {{ site.labels.city }}
```

Use labels when you need to:

- Select sites with `-l` / `--selector`
- Reference simple string values in templates

### Parameters

Values passed directly to **Bicep templates**:

```yaml
parameters:
  clusterName: arc-seattle-prod      # Infrastructure identifier
  brokerConfig:                      # Complex objects for Bicep
    memoryProfile: Medium
    frontendReplicas: 4
```

Use parameters for:

- Infrastructure configuration (cluster names, sizing)
- Values that vary per-site based on capacity
- Complex objects consumed by Bicep templates

#### Top-level vs namespaced parameters

Siteops hands a `site.parameters` entry to a template only when its top-level
key matches one of the template's `param` names. A nested block reaches a
template only if the template declares a matching object parameter (such as
`param brokerConfig`). Otherwise each nested field must be mapped to a
top-level `param` in a `parameters/inputs/*.yaml` file.

Two habits keep this predictable:

- A value used by more than one layer belongs at the top level, as one key the
  layers cannot disagree on. `clusterName` is shared: the AKS Edge Essentials
  host registers the cluster and Azure IoT Operations deploys onto it. Split it
  (host sets one key, AIO reads another) and the bootstrap passes, then AIO
  fails looking up a cluster name that was never registered.
- Group a feature's settings under a namespace for clarity, like the `aksee`
  block. Namespacing is optional: single-purpose values such as `brokerConfig`
  sit at the top level too.

```yaml
parameters:
  clusterName: arc-seattle-prod        # shared: the host registers it, AIO runs on it
  aksee:                               # host bootstrap and upgrade settings
    machineName: arc-seattle-prod-vm   # the Arc machine resource and VM hostname
    customLocationsOid: <object-id>    # custom-locations resource provider object id
```

### Properties

Free-form site state read by manifests and templates via
`{{ site.properties.<path> }}` substitution and `when:` conditions.
Open schema. Siteops does not enforce field names or shapes. The
workspace defines its own conventions.

```yaml
properties:
  # Pinned AIO release (workspace convention). Selects which
  # `parameters/aio-releases/<release>.yaml` gets loaded. This must be a
  # property, not a parameter: parameter-file path interpolation reads
  # `site.properties` and `site.labels`, never `site.parameters`.
  aioRelease: "2608"

  # Ordered resource sets. Each list item names a YAML file in the matching
  # `parameters/` subdirectory. Omit an area for no selection, or use [] to
  # clear an inherited list. Deselecting a set does not delete resources.
  resourceSets:
    devices:
      - site-devices
    assets:
      - site-assets
    dataflows:
      - site-telemetry

  # Capability toggles, kept in one place. Some gate a whole step via
  # `when:` (enableSecretSync, enableGlobalSite, enableEdgeSite). Others
  # pass through to a Bicep `param` (enableCertManager,
  # enableWorkloadIdentity, allowKubernetesMinorUpgrade). `enable*` turns a
  # component on, `allow*` permits a behavior.
  deployOptions:
    enableGlobalSite: false
    enableEdgeSite: false
    enableSecretSync: false
    enableCertManager: true
    allowKubernetesMinorUpgrade: false

  # Free-form custom fields. Anything you reference via
  # `{{ site.properties.X }}` in a manifest, parameters file,
  # or `when:` condition belongs here.
  opcUaEndpoints:
    - name: cnc-machine-1
      address: opc.tcp://10.1.1.100:4840
```

Use properties for:

- Capability toggles, gated via `when:` or passed through to a template (`deployOptions.*`)
- Path-selection keys the engine reads (`aioRelease` picks one release file, and each list under `resourceSets` selects ordered files from the matching `parameters/` subdirectory)
- Free-form data structures consumed via `{{ site.properties.X }}`

> **Template values go in `parameters:`. Capability toggles are the one
> exception.** A name, size, or count the engine hands to a Bicep `param`
> belongs in `parameters:`. On/off toggles stay together under
> `properties.deployOptions`, and when a template needs one, a line in the
> step's `parameters/inputs` file passes it through to the `param`.

### What siteops enforces vs what the workspace conventions are

The siteops engine has a deliberately narrow contract over a site
file. Knowing where the boundary sits tells you what you can rename
when forking the workspace:

| Layer | Owned by | What it cares about |
|---|---|---|
| YAML and preparation mechanics | siteops engine | Top-level fields (`name`, `subscription`, `resourceGroup`, `location`, `labels`, `inherits`, `parameters`, `properties`), selector parsing on `labels`, supported site-value substitutions, and executable filtering against an acquired template schema. |
| Field semantics | The workspace | The names of fields under `properties:` (`aioRelease`, `deployOptions`, the `enable*`/`allow*` toggle prefixes, etc.) and the names of label keys used in selectors (`environment`, `country`, `scope`, etc.). |

Anything in the second row is a convention you can rename for your own
workspace. The iot-operations workspace happens to use
`properties.aioRelease`, `properties.deployOptions.enable*`, and
`labels.environment`. A forked workspace could call them
`properties.release`, `properties.featureFlags.*`, or `labels.tier`
without the engine caring. Just keep manifest `when:` conditions and
`{{ site.properties.X }}` references in sync with whatever the
workspace decides.

### What a site file is checked against

The top-level field set above is **closed**. A key the engine does not read is
rejected when the site loads, rather than being ignored, and the error suggests
the field you probably meant:

```
Site 'munich-dev' has unknown top-level key(s): `paramaters`
  (did you mean `parameters`?). Allowed: ['apiVersion', 'description',
  'inherits', 'kind', 'labels', 'location', 'name', 'parameters',
  'properties', 'resourceGroup', 'subscription'].
  Merged from: sites/base-site.yaml, sites/munich-dev.yaml.
```

The check runs on the merged result of the inherit chain and every overlay, so
the key may come from a file other than the one you named. `Merged from:` lists
those files in merge order, which includes a parent template, an extra trusted
directory, and `sites.local/`.

Rejecting rather than ignoring is what makes a misspelled field visible. It
matters most for `properties`, since resource sets read it to decide what a
site deploys, and a typo there leaves the site on defaults.

Further rules apply:

- **`subscription` and `location` must carry a value.** A key written with
  nothing after the colon parses as null, which is not the same as a default.
  Give it a value, inherit one from a parent template, or remove the key, since
  a blank key overrides the inherited value.
- **`labels`, `properties`, and `parameters` must be mappings** when present.
  Writing one with no value is normalized as an empty mapping before
  inheritance merge, so it preserves values from the parent. Use an explicit
  nested value to clear supported state, such as
  `resourceSets.dataflows: []`.
- **A label value must be text.** Selectors compare text, so `release: 2607`
  matches nothing. Quote it as `release: "2607"`.
- **A field that holds text must hold text.** `name`, `subscription`,
  `resourceGroup`, `location`, `description`, and `inherits` are rejected when
  written as a list or a number. Quote a value YAML would otherwise read as a
  number, such as a site named for a release.
- **`description` is accepted and not read.** It is there so a shared
  `SiteTemplate` can carry a note.
- **`inherits` is read at the top level of the file.** Both shapes inherit that way. A site using
  the `metadata`/`spec` envelope inherits by putting `inherits:` alongside `apiVersion` and `kind`.
  Written inside `spec` it is rejected by name rather than reported as a misspelling, since the
  placement is what is wrong.

A file that declares `spec` and also carries flat-shape fields at the top level
is reported as mixing the two shapes. Pick one: move the fields under
`metadata` and `spec`, or remove `spec` and keep everything at the top level.

What is inside `labels`, `properties`, and `parameters` stays **open**, because
those hold workspace-defined content and the engine stays out of it. A key in
there that nothing reads is a different problem, and the workspace's own test
suite catches it rather than the engine.

### Templates in a parameter name

Supported site expressions resolve in a parameter **name** as well as a value,
so one declaration can key data by site:

```yaml
parameters:
  siteRoles:
    "{{ site.name }}":
      role: primary
```

Keep the template on a **nested** name unless the resolved top-level name is
itself a declared template parameter. Executable preparation filters a
top-level name that the acquired template does not accept and reports any
required parameter that remains missing.

Three cases fail rather than resolve. A name that cannot be resolved, a
template that resolves to a whole object or list, and two names that resolve to
the same string. The last is rejected rather than letting one overwrite the
other.

### Conditionals

Properties support conditionals with truthy syntax:

```yaml
# Truthy check (recommended for booleans)
when: "{{ site.properties.deployOptions.enableSecretSync }}"

# Explicit comparison (also supported)
when: "{{ site.properties.deployOptions.enableSecretSync == true }}"
when: "{{ site.labels.environment == 'prod' }}"
```

### Rule of thumb

- Need to filter sites? → **Labels** (strings only)
- Need in `when` conditionals? → **Labels** (string comparison) or **Properties** (truthy check)
- Goes into Bicep templates? → **Parameters**
- Structured metadata (tags, arrays, deployment options)? → **Properties**

## Site overlays

Sites support layered definitions for separating committed config from local/CI overrides:

```
sites/           # Base definitions (committed to git)
sites.local/     # Overrides (gitignored)
```

**Merge order**: `sites/` → `sites.local/` (later values override earlier)

```yaml
# sites/munich-dev.yaml (committed)
name: munich-dev
subscription: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Placeholder
resourceGroup: placeholder
location: germanywestcentral
```

```yaml
# sites.local/munich-dev.yaml (gitignored)
subscription: "real-subscription-id"
resourceGroup: real-resource-group
```

> **Security**: Only base files (in trusted site directories) can specify `inherits`. Overlays in `sites.local/` cannot inject inheritance.

## Extra trusted site directories

In addition to the workspace's `sites/` directory, Site Ops can search
one or more extra trusted directories for site files. Files in these
directories are treated exactly like files in `sites/`: they are
discoverable by `siteops sites`, they can declare `inherits`, and they
serve as valid base files for the inheritance chain.

Use cases include:

- **CI / end-to-end tests**: keep test-only sites out of `workspaces/*/sites/`
  (production config) and inject them only when the test workflow runs.
- **Cross-repo site libraries**: pull shared sites from another repository
  checked out alongside the workspace.
- **Blueprint catalogs**: keep opinionated site templates in a central
  location, pointed at from multiple workspaces.

Provide extra directories via the CLI or environment variable:

```bash
# Repeatable flag
siteops -w workspace --extra-sites-dir ./tests/e2e/sites sites

# Environment variable (os.pathsep-separated: ';' on Windows, ':' on Unix)
SITEOPS_EXTRA_SITES_DIRS=/path/to/lib-sites siteops -w workspace sites
```

When both are provided, the CLI flag wins and an INFO log records that
the env var was ignored.

**Merge order (full)**:

```
inherits target → sites/ → <extra dirs, in listed order> → sites.local/
```

Extras cannot collide with the workspace's own `sites/` or `sites.local/` directories. The orchestrator rejects both at construction time. Registering `sites.local/` as trusted is specifically refused because it would let overlays inject inheritance and break the overlay security invariant.

### Discovery walks subdirectories

Every trusted directory (`sites/`, each extras dir, `sites.local/`) is scanned recursively. A site at any depth is reachable by its basename (filename without extension), by its relative path under the trusted dir, or by its internal `name:` field. Basename uniqueness within each trusted dir is enforced at load time so the basename shorthand always resolves unambiguously. Cross-dir basename collisions are valid only when the relative path also matches (the overlay pattern).

| Path | Kind | Reachable via |
|---|---|---|
| `sites/munich-prod.yaml` | `Site` | `munich-prod`, internal `name:` |
| `sites/regions/eu/munich-prod.yaml` | `Site` | `munich-prod`, `regions/eu/munich-prod`, internal `name:` |
| `sites/base-site.yaml` | `SiteTemplate` | `inherits: base-site.yaml` only |
| `sites/shared/usa-west.yaml` | `SiteTemplate` | `inherits: shared/usa-west.yaml` only |

See [targeting.md](targeting.md) for the full identity model and CLI grammar.

## Site inheritance

Sites can inherit from shared templates to reduce duplication:

```yaml
# sites/base-site.yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: SiteTemplate
name: base-site

parameters:
  brokerConfig:
    memoryProfile: Medium
    frontendReplicas: 2

properties:
  tags:
    project: iot-operations
    managedBy: siteops
```

```yaml
# sites/munich-dev.yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Site
name: munich-dev
inherits: base-site.yaml

subscription: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
resourceGroup: rg-iot-munich-dev
location: germanywestcentral

labels:
  environment: dev

parameters:
  brokerConfig:
    memoryProfile: Low  # Overrides inherited value
```

### How `inherits:` paths are resolved

Resolution is relative to the **child file's own directory**. The only
exception is the bare-filename fallback (row 1 below), which lets an
extras-dir site inherit a workspace-owned template without copying it.

| Form | Example | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| Bare filename | `inherits: base-site.yaml` | `./base-site.yaml` next to the child, then fallback to `<workspace>/sites/base-site.yaml` |
| Subpath | `inherits: shared/usa-east.yaml` | `<child-dir>/shared/usa-east.yaml` |
| Parent / sibling | `inherits: ../base-site.yaml` | `<child-dir>/../base-site.yaml` |
| Absolute | `inherits: /abs/path/tpl.yaml` | Used as-is |

The fallback searches `<workspace>/sites/` only (never across extras
dirs), so there is no implicit shared-template namespace between trusted
directories.

> **Trust model.** `inherits:` is author-trusted and not filesystem-sandboxed.
> It may point to a sibling `shared/` dir or an absolute path. The control is
> *who may author files in trusted sites locations* (`workspace/sites/` and
> extras dirs). Anyone who can write an `inherits:` value can already set any
> other site field. `sites.local/` overlays strip `inherits:`, so runtime
> overlays cannot introduce new inheritance targets.

### SiteTemplate vs Site

| Aspect | `kind: Site` | `kind: SiteTemplate` |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Can be deployed | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Can be inherited from | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Requires subscription/location | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Discovered by `siteops sites` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

### Merge order with inheritance

`inherits target` → `sites/` → `<extra trusted dirs>` → `sites.local/`

Inherited values are overridden by child site values. Nested objects (labels, parameters, properties) merge recursively. See [Extra trusted site directories](#extra-trusted-site-directories) for how extra dirs participate in the chain.

> **Security**: Only base files (in trusted site directories) can specify `inherits`. Overlays in `sites.local/` cannot inject inheritance, even when extra trusted dirs are configured.

## Site selection from a manifest

A manifest's target sites resolve from three sources: CLI `-l/--selector`
(overrides everything), manifest `sites:` (explicit name list), and manifest
`selector:` (label expression). A manifest with none of the three is a library
or partial. It can be checked with `validate`, but `plan` and `deploy` require
`-l` to supply targets.

```bash
siteops deploy manifests/aio-install.yaml                           # uses manifest selector
siteops deploy manifests/aio-install.yaml -l environment=dev        # CLI overrides manifest
siteops deploy manifests/aio-install.yaml -l name=munich-dev        # single site
siteops deploy manifests/aio-install.yaml -l name=a,name=b          # multi-site (name OR-combines)
```

`-l` is repeatable. Distinct keys AND-combine. Repeated `name=` values OR-combine. Any other duplicate key is an error. Path-form names (`-l name=regions/eu/munich`) work for nested site files. See [targeting.md](targeting.md) for the full grammar, the no-match diagnostic, and the validation rules.

## Scaling to a fleet

Once you cross a handful of sites, two-axis composition (region by environment) duplicates env config across `<region>-dev.yaml` and `<region>-prod.yaml`. The recommended pattern: introduce intermediate `SiteTemplate` files so each concrete site inherits one chain.

```
sites/
├── base-site.yaml                # workspace defaults
├── shared/
│   ├── env-dev.yaml              # SiteTemplate: dev-only labels + parameters
│   ├── env-prod.yaml             # SiteTemplate: prod-only labels + parameters
│   ├── region-eu.yaml            # SiteTemplate: location, country labels
│   └── region-eu-prod.yaml       # SiteTemplate: inherits region-eu, then env-prod
├── munich-dev.yaml               # Site: inherits shared/region-eu.yaml + dev override
├── munich-prod.yaml              # Site: inherits shared/region-eu-prod.yaml
└── ...
```

Each concrete site declares a single `inherits:` parent. The intermediate `SiteTemplate` files capture the cross-cutting axes so that adding a new region or environment is a one-file change instead of N edits across N regions.

> Validate the resolved shape with `siteops -w <workspace> sites <name> --render` before committing the new template chain.
