"""End-to-end integrity of what a deployment reports.

Two contracts here hold only end to end, so each is asserted at the boundary a
consumer actually reads rather than at a helper behind it.

The exit code reflects the fleet. A site whose step fails is counted as failed,
and any failure makes `siteops deploy` exit non-zero. Everything from the step
result through the site status and the summary count to the exit code runs for
real, with only the calls that reach Azure replaced.

A step output reaches the next step. A `{{ steps.<name>.outputs.<key> }}`
reference in a later step's parameter file arrives at the executor carrying the
producing step's value. Asserting on the parameters the executor receives covers
recording the output and forwarding it as well as substituting it.

Templates are ARM JSON so these tests do not depend on a Bicep compiler.
